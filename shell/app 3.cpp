/**
 * `SDL_APP_WILLENTERBACKGROUND` — the Android Home press, and the last moment this process is
 * guaranteed to run.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ **THE PLAN SAID THIS FIRES ON THE JAVA ACTIVITY THREAD. IT DOES NOT, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS
 * THE WHOLE DESIGN OF THIS FUNCTION.** Read out of the vendored SDL 2.30.9 rather than remembered:
 *
 *   1. `SDLActivity.onPause()` → `nativePause()` (SDL_android.c:1264) does exactly ONE thing:
 *      `SDL_SemPost(Android_PauseSem)`. It sends no event and calls nothing of ours.
 *   2. The NATIVE thread discovers that semaphore inside its own `SDL_PollEvent` →
 *      `Android_PumpEvents_Blocking` (SDL_androidevents.c:156), which is what sends
 *      `SDL_APP_WILLENTERBACKGROUND` — and `SDL_PushEvent` dispatches event watchers SYNCHRONOUSLY
 *      (SDL_events.c:1184) before the event is ever queued.
 *   3. Only on the NEXT pump does `isPaused` send the thread into `SDL_SemWait(Android_ResumeSem)`
 *      and freeze it.
 *
 * So this runs **on the native thread, inside the frame loop's own `SDL_PollEvent` call**, one full
 * frame before anything freezes. There is no concurrency with the loop because it IS the loop — which
 * is why this touches `host`, `state` and the project directly with no lock, and why a lock would in
 * fact have been the bug (the loop is not running to release it).
 *
 * ⚠️ A poll-loop `case SDL_APP_WILLENTERBACKGROUND:` would ALSO work here, for a reason worth writing
 * down: `SDL_PollEvent` pumps only when no poll sentinel is pending (SDL_events.c:1092), so a
 * `while (SDL_PollEvent(...))` drain pumps exactly once and cannot block partway through. The watcher
 * is still the right mechanism — it does not depend on that property surviving a future refactor of
 * the loop, and SDL's own `nativeSendQuit` says in as many words that "the user should have handled
 * state storage in SDL_APP_WILLENTERBACKGROUND", because after a quit it FLUSHES the event queue.
 *
 * ⚠️ Inert everywhere else, by construction rather than by `#ifdef`: SDL sends this event on Android
 * and iOS only, so on desktop this function is installed and never called.
 *
 * ⚠️ Every step is IDEMPOTENT, because background→foreground→background fires it again: `stop()` on a
 * stopped transport does nothing, `flush_autosave` is a no-op on a clean document, and
 * `save_settings_if_changed` compares against the bytes on disk.

//
// A DIRECT PORT OF `PixelPerfectRenderer.kt:151-191`, which solved this on Android long before the
// port existed and whose own comment names unconditional repainting "the dominant battery drain on
// the handheld". Kotlin gets two redraw sources: Compose recomposes on a real state change (a cursor
// move, an edit, a new playback row), and an `oscilloscopeTicker` drives ANIMATION — and the loop
// bumps that ticker only while audio is audible, polling cheaply at 20 Hz when it is not.
//
// ⚠️ **THE ONE THING THAT COULD NOT BE COPIED, AND COPYING IT WOULD HAVE ADDED INPUT LAG.** Kotlin's
// visualizer loop is a separate coroutine, so its idle `delay(50L)` slows nothing but itself. Here
// input polling, `host.poll()` and drawing are ALL ONE LOOP: dropping it to 20 Hz would put 50 ms of
// latency on every keypress, on a tracker whose whole point is that a note sounds when you press it.
// So the LOOP stays at 60 Hz and only the DRAW is skipped — the frame still polls input, still pumps
// the scheduler, still runs the watcher. That is the shape of the port, not an approximation of it.
//
// What counts as audible is Kotlin's test exactly: the transport playing, OR any master-waveform
// sample above the silence floor (a one-shot preview still ringing after STOP), OR the preview lane
// active. The threshold is its constant, not a new one.
//
// ⚠️ AUDIBLE IS NOT ANIMATING, and this test answers only the first. Everything that keeps moving
// after the sound has gone — the mixer's markers, the spectrum's bars — is the `metersFalling` term
// below. Kotlin held the same frames open with a 75-frame release tail it re-armed while audible;
// asking the modules whether they are at rest is that, without a number that has to stay true.

    //      pressed during the wait and delivers them in one burst when it ends, onto whatever screen
    //      the load returned to. (Still true of EXPORT, which does not pump — see the plan doc.)

    //

    // per-frame derivations that feed it, runs every FRAME_MS. Both used to run at the display's
    // rate, so an arriving press or MIDI byte waited a mean 8 ms before anything looked at it.
    //
    // ⚠️⚠️ **THE PER-FRAME BLOCK MUST STAY SLOW, AND IT IS THE REASON THIS IS A SPLIT RATHER THAN A
    // FASTER LOOP.** It is layout selection, controller re-derivation, an SDL output-size query, a
    // hot-plug gate and the skin decisions — at 250 Hz it would cost more than the split saves, on
    // the device least able to afford it.
    //
    // ⚠️⚠️ **THE FRAME IS SCHEDULED FROM THE PANEL, NOT FROM A CONSTANT, AND WITH VSYNC THAT IS THE
    // DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A 5 ms POLL AND A 14 ms ONE.** `SDL_RenderPresent` BLOCKS until the display
    // is ready and nothing is polled while it does. A flat 16 ms deadline against a 16.67 ms refresh
    // steps a third of a millisecond earlier into each vblank, so the block grows a frame at a time
    // until it is nearly a whole refresh long — measured, the poll period went to 13.8 ms under a
    // running transport while an idle screen held 4.7. So the next frame is anchored on the present's
    // RETURN, which IS a vblank, and starts half a period before the following one: the draw gets
    // that half to finish in and the display's wait lands in the loop's own paced wait, where input
    // is still being looked at. FRAME_MS is only the fallback for a platform that will not name a
    // refresh rate.

    // its vblank and waits for the next — a dropped frame, which is visible, where being early only
    // costs a little of the block back.
    //
    // ⚠️ THE FAST RATE IS PAID FOR IN WAKE-UPS, SO IT IS ONLY SPENT WHILE SOMETHING IS ARRIVING —

        // changes precisely to keep from burning battery — users would have felt it as warmth.
        //
        // TWO GATES, and they answer different questions:
        //
        //   1. ANIMATION (here). While audio is audible the visualizer is genuinely moving, so the
        //      screen must be redrawn every frame even though no input arrived. When nothing is
        //      audible nothing animates, and a redraw can only reproduce what is already there —
        //      EXCEPT after an input, which may have changed something. `audibleEdge` is Kotlin's
        //      "one final bump on the active→idle edge": the frame where sound stops must still be
        //      drawn once, or the scope freezes mid-wave instead of settling flat.
        //   2. PIXELS (`video.present`). The safety net under gate 1 — if the frame is byte-identical
        //      to what is on screen it is not sent. That is what makes gate 1 safe to be WRONG: a
        //      state change this loop failed to anticipate still gets drawn, and merely costs a
        //      comparison. ⚠️ It is also why gate 1 may be conservative and never has to be clever.
        //
        // ⚠️ The LOOP does not slow down — only the DRAWING stops. Input, `host.poll()` and the
        // lifecycle watcher all still run on every POLL_MS tick. Kotlin could afford `delay(50L)` when
        // idle because its visualizer was a separate coroutine; here that would be 50 ms of input lag.
        // ⚠️ `has_pending_timed_work()` is the third term and it is NOT covered by the pixel net: the
        // status line clears itself 3 s after it is set, with no input, and a frame that is never
        // drawn is never compared. Without it a "PROJECT SAVED" would sit on a still screen forever.
        //
        // ⚠️ `resizeSettle` is the FOURTH, and it is a rotation/resize term the pixel net cannot cover
        // either: a settling surface must be repainted at its NEW geometry with no input, or the C7 skip
        // freezes a half-transitioned frame (the reported "rotate → half black / half theme bg, fixed
        // only by touching a button"). While it counts down we both DRAW and clear the pixel-skip
        // (invalidate_backbuffer), so each settle frame is genuinely re-uploaded at the current size.
        //
        // ⚠️ `metersFalling` is the FIFTH, and it is the one place where "audible" and "animating" come
        // apart. The MIXER's peak markers age one segment per 60 ms peak poll and the SPECTRUM strip's
        // bars and peak dots age one step per FRAME, but both age INSIDE the draw — so gate 1 closing is
        // what stops them, and the pixel net cannot help because a frame that is never drawn is never
        // compared. Stop the transport and each hangs for the fall it still owes (the markers ~5 s, the
        // spectrum ~1 s), stepping down once per input instead — any input, mapped or not, because every
        // SDL event sets `sawInput` and buys exactly one frame. The EQ editor's spectrum panel is a third
        // case and a different one: nothing in it ages, but it is only ever as current as the last frame
        // drawn, so a closed gate strands whatever was on screen. See TrackerLayout::has_falling_meters:
        // every term is gated there on its module being drawn at all, since nothing off-screen ages and
        // nothing would ever bring this term back to false.
