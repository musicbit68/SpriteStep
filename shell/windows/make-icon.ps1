#
# The .ico is COMMITTED — this script is not part of any build, and CI never runs it. It exists so
# the icon is a derived artifact with a stated source rather than a binary someone once dropped in
# the tree, which is the same reason `docs/licenses/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` is the source of truth for
# the notices instead of a folder of files.
#
# The source is logo-app.png — the full-bleed device-shot mark (the rainbow grille + "pocket
# TRACKER") that is SPRITESTEP's icon across every platform. Cross-platform consistency is the
# reason it is used here rather than logo-plain.png: the app should show ONE icon whether it is on a
# phone's launcher, a handheld's game list, or a Windows taskbar. An earlier version of this script
# preferred logo-plain (the chunky PT blocks) on the argument that a detailed device shot turns to
# mush at 16px — that tradeoff is real and is accepted here in favour of the single recognisable
# mark. logo-app.png is a 256×256 export of the master icon (docs/internal/images/logo-500.ico,
# frame 0), extracted lossless; keep them in step if the master ever changes.
#
# ⚠️ No ImageMagick, no Pillow, no conversion site. Python on this box needs elevation and a build
# asset should not depend on a tool the next person has to install, so the ICO container is written
# out by hand below. It is a 6-byte header, a 16-byte directory entry per size, and the images.
