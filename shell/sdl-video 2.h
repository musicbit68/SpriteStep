// sdl-video.{h,cpp} — the window, the 640×480 streaming texture, and the scaler.
//
// The other half of the shell seam. `pt-ui` draws the whole app into a 640×480 ARGB framebuffer and
// knows nothing about a display; this file is the only code that does. It uploads that framebuffer to
// one streaming texture and blits it to the screen, which is the port plan's §4.5 video plan
// unchanged: "render the 640×480 design into a streaming texture; present with integer scale
// (default) or fit-stretch (setting)". ⚠️ Read "fit-stretch" as "fit at a fractional scale", NOT as
// "stretch to the window edges" — taking that word literally is what put an aspect-breaking stretch
// behind the SCALING row; see `ScalingMode` below.
//
// GPU-optional on purpose. SDL_Renderer will take an accelerated backend when the device has one and
// fall back to software when it does not — and a single 640×480 blit is trivial either way. That
// sidesteps the classic PortMaster failure (a device whose GL blobs are missing or 32-bit-only, e.g.
// TrimUI's GE8300) with no code: there is no shader here to fail.

/**
 * INTEGER scales by a whole number — every design pixel becomes an N×N block. FIT scales by a
 * FRACTIONAL factor and filters the result. **Both preserve the 4:3 aspect ratio and letterbox the
 * remainder**; neither ever stretches the design out of shape.
 *
 * This is a real choice rather than a preference, and the reason is the device zoo: 640×480 is 1×
 * exactly on the RG35xx class, but a TrimUI Smart Pro is 1280×720 and an RGB30 is 720×720. On those,
 * INTEGER means 1× with thick borders (crisp, small) while FIT means 1.5× filling the height with
 * thinner ones (bigger, soft). Neither is right for everyone, so it becomes a setting — with INTEGER
 * as the default, because a pixel-art tracker that has been pixel-perfect since it was born should
 * not go blurry the first time it meets a 720p handheld.
 *
 * ⚠️ FIT used to stretch to the window edges, which is a divergence from the Kotlin app this ports —
 * see `dest_rect()` in the .cpp for the mechanism and the three Kotlin call sites that settle it.
 * ⚠️ On an output that IS a whole multiple of the design the two modes now compute the same rect, and
 * differ only in the sampling filter. That is correct, not a bug: it is why the setting was invisible
 * on desktop until the window became resizable.
