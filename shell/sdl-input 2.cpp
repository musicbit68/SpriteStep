 * starter template is generated from it (`default_keyboard_bindings`), so what the file tells the user
 * their keys are is derived from the same rows the app dispatches through. A switch can be read by the
 * compiler and by a human, and by nothing else.
 *
 * Order matters in one narrow way: `default_keyboard_bindings` emits each button's names in the order
 * they appear here, so the primary key of a pair should come first — the template reads as
 * `"A": ["K", "Return"]`, which is the order a user thinks in.
