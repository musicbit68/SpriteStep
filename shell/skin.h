// ─── shell/skin.h — the touch-skin textures, decoded once and owned by the renderer (D1/D2/D7) ───
//
// Phase D's touch skin is chrome drawn AROUND the 640×480 frame, in device-resolution space, in the
// shell's `present()` — never in the canvas (pt-ui keeps its four primitives; see image.h). This holds
// the SDL textures for one theme's skin: the PNGs are read through the D7 asset seam (assets.h),
// decoded through the D2 decoder (image.h), and uploaded to `SDL_Texture`s here, once, at load.
//
// It is the SHELL's, and its lifetime is the RENDERER's: the textures are created from an
// `SDL_Renderer*` and must be destroyed before it is (`unload()` before `SdlVideo::close()`).
//
// ⚠️ This holder is deliberately SEMANTIC-FREE: a `SkinPiece` names the FILE it came from, not the band
// it lands in. Which piece goes where — the top panel, the bezel the frame sits inside, the button
// cluster — is the RENDERER's knowledge (ScreenLayouts.kt / VirtualControlsPortrait2), and belongs in
// the code that computes the destination rects, not in the thing that merely owns the pixels.

// Which ART SET a theme ships. A theme carries exactly one, and the choice decides three things at

// them. `kFiles` in skin.cpp says which sets each file belongs to — a file may belong to more than
// one, which is how the two shape-only sets share the same generic button art.
//
//   Chrome       — the four background bands plus the generic button shapes, in the skin's own
//                  colours; the button CHARACTERS are drawn over them in a font by the renderer.
//                  `amiga` and `amiga-2`.
//   Bitmap       — one image PER BUTTON, each already carrying its own character, so nothing is drawn
//                  on top. No background art at all. `amiga-bitmap`.
//   Transparent  — the generic button SHAPES alone, authored as white ink on transparent, and no
//                  background art: the shapes are tinted to the live theme and the characters are
//                  drawn over them in a font, in that same colour. `amiga-transparent`.

     * without (say) the dark button variants should draw the rest rather than nothing. Returns how many
     * pieces loaded. When `log`, prints one `skin:` line per piece with its dimensions or MISS — the
     * on-device readout that tells a real decode from a silent no-op (there is no console assertion for
     * this on a phone; the log line IS the assertion).
     *
     * `art` selects which pieces to attempt (see SkinArt) — a chrome theme is never asked for
     * per-button art, nor the reverse, so the MISS lines stay real misses rather than twenty lines of
     * "this theme was never going to have that".
     *
     * ⚠️ It also changes HOW the Bitmap set is uploaded. That art is two-colour and OPAQUE (black
     * ground, white ink), but it is drawn TINTED to the live tracker theme — so the ink's brightness
     * becomes ALPHA and the colour becomes flat white, leaving `SDL_SetTextureColorMod` free to pick
     * the ink colour per frame and the black ground to fall away to whatever is behind it. Uploading it
     * as-is would paint an opaque black box no colour mod could lighten. Scaling is NEAREST for the
     * same art, not the others' LINEAR: it is pixel art, and smoothing it is the one thing that would
     * stop it reading as pixel art.
     *
     * ⚠️ The Transparent set needs NEITHER — it is authored white-on-transparent already, so it goes up
     * untouched and tints straight away, and its edges are anti-aliased curves that want the smoothing.
     * The rule both branches follow is "match the handling to what the art IS", not to which set it is in.
