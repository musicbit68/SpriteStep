// midi-in-base.{h,cpp} — the part of a `songcore::IMidiIn` backend that is NOT per-platform.
//
// The mirror of midi-out-base.h, written for the same reason and at the same layer: there are three
// backends (winmm at E2, ALSA rawmidi and Android's `MidiManager` at E5), and the device list, the spec
// resolver and the counters are identical for all three. Written once here they cannot diverge in one
// of the copies; written three times they will.
//
// ⚠️ The three differ in ONE thing above the platform line — how a byte gets here. winmm and ALSA PUSH
// (a system callback, a reader thread of ours); Android is POLLED through `pump()` below. That is one
// virtual with an empty default, not a second mechanism — see the note on it.
//
// ⚠️ **IT ALSO OWNS THE SINK, AND THAT IS NOT TIDINESS.** A backend's bytes arrive on a thread nobody
// chose, and `deliver()` below is the ONE door they come through — so it is the one place that can
// count them. Without that count, an input port has the worst failure mode in this repo: a component
// whose correct behaviour is SILENCE, indistinguishable from one whose callback never fired at all.
// `bytes_received()` and `callbacks()` are what tell those two apart, and every console line prints
// them beside the verdict.
//
// ── ⚠️⚠️ WHAT MAY RUN ON THE CALLBACK THREAD ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Almost nothing, and the constraint is the platform's rather than ours. winmm documents its low-level
// MIDI callback as being allowed to call only a short list of functions — `EnterCriticalSection`,
// `midiOutShortMsg`, `PostMessage`, `SetEvent` and a handful more — because the callback can run in an
// interrupt-like context where the CRT's locks are not available: **a `printf` or a `malloc` there is a
// deadlock, not a slow path.** So `deliver()` does exactly two things, an atomic add and a call into
// `MidiInQueue::on_bytes` (a `std::mutex` and a memcpy, no allocation), and the TRACE that would be the
// obvious instrument here does not exist: the console prints from `SongcoreHost::poll()`, on the app's
// own thread, where a message rather than a byte is the useful unit anyway.
