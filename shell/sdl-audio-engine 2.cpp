 * shell for any platform (convergence plan A4; every desktop artifact to date was hand-made on one
 * Linux box). The rest of the shell tells time with SDL_GetTicks64, but that is millisecond-resolution
 * and the work measured here runs in tens of microseconds — so this takes SDL's high-resolution
 * monotonic counter instead, which is the same clock underneath on both platforms.
 *
 * Integer arithmetic, split around the division: `counter * 1e9` overflows uint64 outright on a box
 * that has been up a while (a 10 MHz counter reaches 1e13 in a few weeks, and 1e13 * 1e9 does not fit),
 * which would make the profiler print garbage on exactly the long-running session worth profiling.

//
// ⚠️⚠️ **48000 BECAUSE ASKING FOR 44100 BOUGHT A SILENT CONVERSION ON EVERY DEVICE MEASURED.** The

// reported was the hardware's own 1024-frame period divided by 44100/48000. Asked for 48000 the same
// device reports 1024. ⚠️ It removes a conversion and NOT latency — the buffer's duration is
// unchanged (21.32 → 21.33 ms on that device).
//
// ⚠️⚠️ **ON WINDOWS THIS IS A FALLBACK AND NOTHING MORE** — `windows_endpoint_rate()` below. A desktop

 * format with what was asked for, so `SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FREQUENCY_CHANGE` can never fire and the boot
 * line reports the request back as though it were the hardware. Measured: with a 44.1 kHz headset as
 * the default output, asking 48000 gave `48000 Hz, 480 frames` with a resampler in the path, and the
 * only way to tell was asking the OS which endpoint held the process's audio session.
 *
 * ⚠️ `eConsole` is by definition the endpoint SDL opens when it is passed a null device name. It is
 * NOT an enumeration index — index 0 is whatever was listed first and need not be the default at all,
 * which is exactly how an earlier diagnostic came to print a rate unrelated to the open stream.
