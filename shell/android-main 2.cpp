//   SIGTERM/SIGINT → a flag the loop polls   nothing (⚠️ C4 — see the terminate_requested note below)
//   SDL_Init / SDL_Quit, here                SDL_Init here too; SDLActivity owns the surface, not this
//   SdlAudioEngine                           OboeAudioEngine  ← the whole of C3's audio work
//   StdFileSystem over the app root          SafFileSystem — the app holds no storage permission
//   default_app_root(), one root twice       two roots from Java: media tree + app-private files
//   PlatformCaps::sdl(debug), console on     PlatformCaps::converged(...) — see where it is set below
//
// ⚠️ **NO `SDL_MAIN_HANDLED` HERE, AND THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF `main.cpp`.** SDL_main.h defines
// `SDL_MAIN_NEEDED` on `__ANDROID__` and with it `#define main SDL_main`, so the `main` below is
// compiled as `SDL_main` — which is the symbol `SDLActivity` looks up by name (`getMainFunction()`)
// with `dlsym` in the last library `getLibraries()` names. Define SDL_MAIN_HANDLED as the desktop

// through to the RELATIVE path "SPRITESTEP", i.e. beside whatever the process's cwd happens to be.

// platform nobody resolved a root for is already broken. Only Java knows where
// `Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(DIRECTORY_DOCUMENTS)` actually is on this device and
// this OS version, so the activity resolves it and passes it down through `getArguments()`.
//
// The fallback below exists so a bring-up cannot be blocked by a missing argument, and it SAYS SO in
// the log rather than quietly guessing — a silently wrong root would present as "all my projects are

// ─── stdout/stderr → logcat ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The shared shell's boot banner and its once-a-second status line are THE bring-up instrument — the
// half of this app that answers "did my samples load?", "where did it put its folders?", "did it find
// my crash file?". On Android they go to a stdout that is `/dev/null` unless somebody has set
// `log.redirect-stdio`, which needs root on most devices. So the two lessons this project has already
// paid for both apply here and neither is satisfied by default: `main.cpp`'s `setvbuf` note (a
// buffered stdout loses everything when the process is killed, which is how a bring-up ends), and that
// an instrument not pointed at the thing tells you nothing about it.
//
// Twenty lines of pipe-and-pump fixes both, and it is platform residue in the strictest sense —
// nothing above this file knows it happened.
//
// ⚠️ **AND THE SAME LINES GO TO A FILE, because logcat is unreachable to the person who has the bug.**
// Reading logcat needs a PC, developer mode and USB debugging; a user reporting "it opened without the
// on-screen buttons" has none of those, and that report is about the boot itself — the one moment
// nobody can be talked through capturing live. So the pump tees into `spritestep-log.txt`, which the
// user reaches with any file manager and attaches to a mail. It is TRUNCATED at start (a session log,
// not a history) and capped, so it cannot grow into the user's storage.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ **IT IS WRITTEN TWICE OVER, TO TWO DIFFERENT PLACES, AND BOTH ARE REQUIRED.** The app holds no
// storage permission, so at the moment the first line is written the only directory it can certainly
// write to is `filesDir` — which the user cannot reach. The granted tree, which they CAN reach, does not
// exist yet on a fresh install and is not known until the filesystem has asked Java for it, several
// screens of boot later. So the log opens in `filesDir` at once and RELOCATES into the granted tree as
// soon as there is one, replaying everything written so far (`relocate_log_file`). Neither half alone
// satisfies the requirement this file has to meet — that a user with no PC can find it and attach it
// to a mail — and the app is unusable until a folder is granted anyway, so the reachable copy always
// covers the sessions that can have a bug worth reporting.
//
// ⚠️ `getExternalFilesDir()` is not the answer to this and never was: Android 11+ hides `Android/data`

    // portrait would stand its screen on end. Same fact `useTouch` is built from.
