# Cross-compile the SPRITESTEP SDL shell for aarch64 — the PortMaster CFW target arch.
#
# Host: an amd64 Linux with the aarch64 cross toolchain (Ubuntu: `crossbuild-essential-arm64`).
#
#   cmake -S shell -B build/aarch64 -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
#         -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=shell/toolchain-aarch64.cmake
#   cmake --build build/aarch64
#   file build/aarch64/spritestep-sdl        # -> ELF 64-bit ... ARM aarch64
#
# SDL2: shell/CMakeLists.txt calls find_package(SDL2) and FetchContent-builds it STATIC when the host
# has none — which is what happens on a cross box. That yields a self-contained binary, ideal for CI
# build-validation and a qemu-user smoke-test (proven: it boots, decodes media, runs the frame loop and
# exits on SIGTERM under emulation).
#
# ⚠️ For a DEVICE-RUNNABLE artifact, two things change and neither is in this file:
#   1. glibc floor — build on PortMaster's Ubuntu 20.04 base, not a newer host, or the binary demands a
#      glibc newer than the CFWs carry (this validation host is 24.04 / glibc 2.39).
#   2. SDL2 — put an arm64 SDL2 on CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH so find_package succeeds and the shell links it
#      DYNAMICALLY; the device ships its own patched libSDL2 (KMSDRM + ALSA), which is the one to use.
