// sdl-touch.{h,cpp} — the on-screen virtual gamepad (convergence D3/D4/D5, landscape).
//
// The one part of the Android app with no C++ twin (convergence plan §6), landed as the plan's D1
// split says: the hit-rect LAYOUT is shared, portable C++ (`native/ui/touch_layout.h`), and the
// RENDERING is shell-side — the buttons are chrome drawn AROUND the letterboxed 640×480 frame, not
// content inside the canvas, so `pt-ui` keeps its four primitives and never learns about a panel.
//
// This file is the shell half. It:
//   • places the two LANDSCAPE boxes into the letterbox bars either side of the frame (D5) — the
//     centred frame already leaves a bar on each side, and those bars ARE the panels, so nothing about
//     the scaler had to change;
//   • turns an SDL finger into a `Button` by hit-testing the shared rects, and feeds it through
//     `SdlInput`'s OWN press/release (D4) — inheriting the mods snapshot, the one key-repeat engine and
//     the held-button de-dup for free, exactly as Kotlin routes its virtual buttons through
//     `InputMapper.onVirtualButton`;
//   • draws the boxes, the buttons and their labels with the shared 5×5 font, highlighting a held one.
//
// ⚠️ LANDSCAPE panels + PORTRAIT2 hit-test. `layout()` draws AND hit-tests the two landscape bars;
// `layout_portrait2()` hit-tests the PORTRAIT2 skinned grid (which `PortraitSkin` draws — this file only
// maps the finger). Still missing: PORTRAIT's two-box split (`touch_layout.h` has `left_rects`/
// `right_rects` for the bars; the portrait split reuses them). The SETTINGS LAYOUT row
// (PlatformCaps::touchLayouts) stays OFF until every mode exists, because a picker offering modes that
// do nothing is the "setting which configures nothing" platform_caps.h refuses.
