# SPRITESTEP — OnionOS (Miyoo Mini / Mini+) launch script.
#
# ⚠️ /bin/sh, NOT bash. OnionOS's userland is busybox ash; there is no bash on the device, and a
# `#!/bin/bash` here is an app that does nothing at all when you press A on it.
#
# ⚠️ IT IS NOT ONION THAT RUNS THIS DIRECTLY. The package installs as a PORT, so the chain is
# Onion's ports launcher -> SPRITESTEP.port -> Emu/PORTS/launch_standalone.sh -> here. That
# middle script already exports libs/ and clears LD_PRELOAD; both are repeated below so this file
# still works when it is run on its own, which is how it is debugged over SSH.
#
# =============================================================================================
#  This is NOT the PortMaster script and must not be made to look like one.
# =============================================================================================
#
# The two differ on the one thing that matters most, and in OPPOSITE directions:
#
#   PortMaster   links the DEVICE's libSDL2 — the copy its CFW patched for that hardware — and
#                deliberately sets no LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
#   here         there IS no system libSDL2. Every Miyoo port carries the `mmiyoo` fork itself, so
#                the libs/ directory beside this script is load-bearing rather than a mistake.
#
# The gptokeyb warning in the PortMaster script does not apply either: OnionOS has no gptokeyb and
# the buttons arrive as plain SDL keycodes, which is what the shipped key map sets.

# Samples/, Soundfonts/, Instruments/, Renders/ and Themes/ are right there, rather than four levels
# down inside a ports folder. The app creates all six at boot, so a card can be pulled, filled and
# put back.
#
# ⚠️ IT IS ALSO AN UPGRADE PATH. This path is what the App-shelf package used, so a tester who
# replaces that package with this one keeps every song they have written.

# file after that — so if it boots first, this device keeps the DESKTOP key map permanently and the
# collisions in miyoo-config.json's header are what the user gets.

# looks applied and is not.

# ── The demo song, seeded ONCE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# the normal public build rather than an error.
#
# ⚠️⚠️ GUARDED BY A MARKER, NOT BY "IS THE PROJECT THERE" — and the difference is the user's own
# work. Seeding on a missing file would restore a demo they deleted on purpose, and worse, would
# overwrite the copy of it they had spent an evening editing. The marker means the seed happens on a
# fresh card and never again; wipe $PT_HOME and it seeds afresh, which is the recovery.
#
# ⚠️ `cp -r <dir> "$PT_HOME/"` per top-level folder, NOT a glob over the files: the sample names
# contain spaces, and an unquoted glob hands `cp` "808" and "Bass.wav" as two arguments. Copying the
# directories merges them into the ones the app makes, and carries any sub-folder with it.

# ── The audio device, taken back from Onion ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ⚠️⚠️ WITHOUT THIS THE APP EXITS DURING START-UP ON A REAL DEVICE, and it looks like a launcher
# problem rather than an audio one: Onion runs a resident `audioserver` that holds the SigmaStar AO
# device open and ENABLED, the chip will not let a second owner set the output attributes while it
# is, and so MI_AO_SetPubAttr answers 0xa0052009 — module AO, "operation not permitted".
# SDL_OpenAudioDevice then fails and shell/main.cpp treats no audio as fatal, which is the whole of
# the "starts and closes again" report.
#
# This is Onion's own `KillAudioserver` flag from its ports collection, and the script below is what
# implements it there: it stops the server AND re-applies the user's volume to whichever process
# claims the device next — which is us. Prefer it over killing the process ourselves for exactly
# that second half.
#
# ⚠️⚠️ THE PORT SHORTCUT LEAVES THAT FLAG OFF ON PURPOSE, so this block is the only thing doing
# it. Onion's launcher stops the server and starts the app immediately; the wait below is what
# that path is missing, and the wait only runs when this script is the one that found a server
# to stop.
#
# ⚠️ NOTHING HERE PUTS THE SERVER BACK. Onion restarts it on the way to the menu (`start_audioserver`
# in .tmp_update/runtime.sh), and a restart from here would take the device away from the app we are
# about to hand it to. The volume KEYS are unaffected either way — Onion sets the level by ioctl
# straight on /dev/mi_ao, which is below the server; what the server holds is the level itself, and
# Onion's script is what carries that across to whoever takes the device next.
#
# ⚠️ `miyoodir` IS DEFAULTED FIRST, and it is not cosmetic. One branch of Onion's script restarts
# `wpa_supplicant` and `udhcpc` from `$miyoodir/app/…` when it finds `libpadsp.so` preloaded into
# them — with the variable unset it would kill the two and fail to start them again, and the
# tester loses Wi-Fi until a reboot. Onion exports it from init_env.sh, so this only ever fires
# where the environment did not reach us.
