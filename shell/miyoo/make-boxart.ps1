# Regenerate shell/miyoo/boxart.png — the image Onion shows beside SPRITESTEP in its ports list.
#
# NO BUILD RUNS THIS, the same way shell/windows/make-icon.ps1 is not run by a build: the PNG is
# committed, because build-miyoo.sh runs under WSL/Linux where there is no image tooling to rely on,
# and artwork that regenerates itself on every build is a diff nobody asked for.
#
#     pwsh -File shell/miyoo/make-boxart.ps1
#
# 256x360 is the size of Onion's own port artwork, read off the images its Ports Collection ships
# (static/packages/.../Roms/PORTS/Imgs/*.png), not guessed. It is portrait because the list draws it
# as a game's box; the logo is square, so it sits in the upper part with the name beneath it.
#
# ⚠️ THE FILE NAME MUST MATCH THE SHORTCUT'S. Onion pairs Roms/PORTS/Imgs/<name>.png with
# Roms/PORTS/Shortcuts/<name>.port by base name alone, and a mismatch is simply no picture —
# build-miyoo.sh stages this file under the shortcut's name rather than under this one.
