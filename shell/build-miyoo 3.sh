# ⚠️ NO CONTAINER, and that is the difference from build-portmaster.sh. That build needs

# so the ceiling asserted below is a property of the toolchain rather than of the machine you are
# sitting at. What this script must not do is fall back on a system arm-linux-gnueabihf — that one
# finds its headers in the HOST's /usr/include and produces an ELF the device cannot load.
#
# ⚠️ Nothing here is filtered down to the word "error". Every command prints its own output. Four
# separate sessions of this project have been burned by a build step that failed quietly and left a

# two anchors so the question asked here is the question the device asks.
