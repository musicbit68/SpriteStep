# ⚠️ THE SDL2 WE BUILD IS A LINK-TIME SDK AND IS NEVER SHIPPED. The port runs against the DEVICE's
# libSDL2 — the copy its CFW patched for that hardware's display (KMSDRM) and audio (ALSA). Shipping
# our own would shadow the one that actually knows the screen.
#
# So the version here is not "the newest that works", it is THE COMPATIBILITY FLOOR, and pinning it
# low turns a claim into a guarantee: you cannot link a symbol that does not exist in the .so you
# linked against, so if the shell ever reaches for a newer SDL API this build FAILS HERE, loudly, on
# a dev box — instead of on a stranger's handheld as `undefined symbol`. 2.0.18 is the floor because
# the shell calls SDL_GetTicks64(), which landed in exactly that release; everything else it needs is
# 2.0.0-era. Raise this ONLY together with the requirement in shell/portmaster/README.md.

# TWO layouts come out of this build, and they are not the same tree.

# $STAGE is the CATALOG REPO layout: exactly what gets copied into PortMaster-New's
# `ports/spritestep/`. Its five root files are the ones `tools/build_release.py` requires there
# (port.json, README.md, screenshot.{png|jpg}, gameinfo.xml, the launch script) — a screenshot one
# level down reads to that checker as a port with no screenshot at all.
#
#   $STAGE/
#   |- SPRITESTEP.sh
#   |- port.json
#   |- gameinfo.xml
#   |- README.md
#   |- screenshot.png
#   `- spritestep/
#      |- spritestep.aarch64
#      `- licenses/
#
# The ZIP is a different shape, and which shape is not ours to pick: upstream's `build_port_zip()`
# moves those four metadata files INTO the port directory, renames README.md to `<portname>.md`, and
# leaves only the launch script at the root. Step 5 reproduces that transform, so the zip a tester
# installs is the zip the catalog will later hand a user — and so `gameinfo.xml`'s
# `./spritestep/screenshot.png` resolves on the device, which is the same file the checker wanted
# at the root. One file, two correct places, one transform between them.
#
# ⚠️ The two names must agree: the port directory and the binary's stem are both `spritestep`
# (lowercase, the catalog's rule), while the launch script is capitalised.
