// ─── shell/device_skin.h — the selectable PORTRAIT2 device skins (convergence D-theme) ─────────────
//
// The shell-side twin of Kotlin's `DeviceSkin` table (ui/theme/DeviceTheme.kt). One entry per portrait
// skin the SETTINGS > LAYOUT row can cycle: which asset folder its PNGs come from, and the three scalars
// the PNG set does NOT carry — the casing fill painted behind/around the skin, the button-label colour,
// and the bezel border in skin X-units.
//
// It is the RENDERER's knowledge (which theme paints the chrome), so it lives shell-side beside
// `skin.{h,cpp}` and `portrait2.{h,cpp}`, not in pt-ui — the canvas stays theme-free (skin.h). The list
// ORDER is the SETTINGS cycle order and the persisted index space (NORM first, DARK second), matching
// Kotlin's `DeviceSkin.ALL`. The persisted key is the `id` STRING, resolved to an index at boot, so the
// choice survives the list being reordered — the "stable string, not an index" contract settings_store.h
// spelled out for exactly this (LAYOUT/SKIN were deferred until Phase D could resolve a name to a list).
//
// Both CHROME skins ship a bezel PNG, so `bezelThicknessX` is 3 for each (a solid-colour bezel would
// use a dp fallback, which no shipping skin needs). Values lifted from
// `DeviceSkin.AMIGA_NORMAL/AMIGA_DARK` and `DeviceTheme.AMIGA` (screenBezelThicknessX = 3). The skins
// that draw no chrome have no bezel to thicken and leave it at 0.

//
// ⚠️ BMAP and TRNS are not more sets of chrome art. Anything but `SkinArt::Chrome` turns three things
// over at once:
//   * the ART — BMAP's is per-button, each image carrying its own character, so the renderer draws no
//     text over it; TRNS's is the generic square/wide SHAPE alone, with the usual label drawn on top;
//   * the LAYOUT is `portrait2_skin_bare` for both — no panels, no branding, no backing, no bezel, so
//     the tracker gets the full device width;
//   * the COLOURS are the LIVE tracker theme's (background behind, TXT VALUE for the keys and their
//     labels), not the two constants below — which is why their `casingFillArgb`/`labelRgb` are left
//     at 0. Those are read only on the Chrome path; leaving them at 0 keeps a stray reader honest by
//     making a mistaken use come out black rather than plausibly beige.
