// button_feedback.h — the click + haptic a VIRTUAL button gives back (convergence D, Android-only).
//
// The last of the Android device features the SDL shell had no twin for. It is the ONE outward hook
// the convergence plan's Phase-E table names: "its TRIGGER moves into the shell's touch path (one
// outward JNI hook)". Everything a phone user feels when they tap the on-screen gamepad — the SoundPool
// click and the Vibrator pulse — is Java's, because both are Android system services; what is portable
// is only the DECISION to fire, and that lives in `sdl-touch.cpp` beside the press it already emits.
//
// ⚠️ WHY AN INTERFACE AND NOT AN `#ifdef` IN sdl-touch.cpp. The same reason `AudioBackend` is one:
// sdl-touch.cpp is SHARED, compiled on desktop and on Android both, and it must not learn the word
// `jni`. The platform's `main` constructs the concrete feedback (Android → a JNI shim; desktop → none
// at all, the pointer stays null) and hands it down through `AppConfig`, exactly as it hands down the
// audio backend and the filesystem. A build with no touchscreen constructs nothing and pays nothing.
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS PURELY UI FEEDBACK, NOT PART OF THE INPUT MEANING. The click sounds on the raw finger
// down/up, NOT on the synthetic key-repeats a held D-pad produces, and NOT on physical pad/keyboard
// buttons — a handheld with real buttons makes no UI click. That is why the trigger sits in the TOUCH
// layer (`handle_finger`) and not in `SdlInput` or the dispatcher: it mirrors Kotlin exactly, where
// `LocalButtonEventCallback` is wired only into the VirtualControls composables.
