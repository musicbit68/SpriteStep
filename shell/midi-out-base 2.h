// midi-out-base.{h,cpp} — the part of a `songcore::IMidiOut` backend that is NOT per-platform.
//
// `IMidiOut` is five methods and deliberately tiny (see native/songcore/midi_out.h). But a backend
// needs more than five methods to be usable at a desk: a device list on the console, a spec resolver
// for the env-var override, a one-shot test note, a byte trace, and a rejected-message counter.
// None of that touches the platform — it is written entirely in terms of the five virtuals — and
// with three backends coming (winmm, ALSA, Android) it is exactly the kind of thing that gets
// copied twice and then diverges in one of the copies.
//
// ⚠️ The counters in particular are load-bearing rather than decorative. `IMidiOut::send` returns
// void, because nothing above it could do anything useful with a failure mid-phrase — so a send path
// that fails silently is indistinguishable from one that works. Every backend counts, and every
// console line prints the count beside the verdict.
