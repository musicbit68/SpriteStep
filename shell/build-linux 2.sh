# This is the DESKTOP x86-64 package. The handheld aarch64 one is shell/build-portmaster.sh, and the
# two are deliberately different builds rather than one script with a flag — they disagree about the
# thing that matters most, which is SDL2. The PortMaster package links against the DEVICE's libSDL2
# (its CFW patched that copy for the hardware's display and audio); a desktop links whatever the
# distro ships. Neither can stand in for the other.
#
# ⚠️ Nothing here is filtered. Every command prints its own output — a build step that fails quietly
# and leaves a stale artifact behind for the next step to "verify" is the failure this project has
# been bitten by repeatedly.

SPRITESTEP $VERSION — Linux (x86-64)

Run:
    ./SPRITESTEP

Requires SDL2 at runtime (most distributions call the package libsdl2-2.0-0 or sdl2):
    Debian / Ubuntu   sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0
    Fedora            sudo dnf install SDL2
    Arch              sudo pacman -S sdl2

Your files live in \$XDG_DATA_HOME/SPRITESTEP (usually ~/.local/share/SPRITESTEP):

    Projects/     songs (.ptp)
    Samples/      WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, Opus, M4A
    Soundfonts/   .sf2

Set SPRITESTEP_HOME to put them somewhere else.
