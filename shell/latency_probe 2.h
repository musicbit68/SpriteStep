// latency_probe.h — what the app can know about its own latency, measured rather than read.
//
// latency-review.md §1 puts two large terms in the budget and both are READINGS, not results: the wait
// for the app to look at an input, and the time an audio block spends in the output buffer (claimed
// 12–42 ms). This measures the first outright and the honest half of the second, and it is
// deliberately loud about the half it cannot see. `ptlat` and a microphone are the only things that
// can see that half.
//
// ⚠️ **TWO PERIODS, BECAUSE THE LOOP HAS TWO RATES** (app.cpp, THE TWO RATES). The POLL period is the
// one that costs an input its wait; the FRAME period is the drawing, and it is here because the split
// that made the first small is exactly the thing that could quietly wreck the second.
//
// ⚠️ **A GLOBAL, AND DELIBERATELY NOT ON THE AUDIO SEAM.** The frame loop and the audio callback are
// on different threads in different files, and the only object they share is `AudioBackend`. That seam
// reports what the DEVICE is doing — its rate, its latency — and carries no instrument: accumulators
// put there would be shipped on every platform forever for the sake of a diagnostic that is off by
// default. So they sit here, written with relaxed atomics from both sides and read once on the way out,
// and `report` is handed the seam's latency figure as an argument.
//
// ⚠️ **TWO WINDOWS, NOT ONE, AND THE SPLIT IS THE POINT.** §11: a figure taken with the transport
// stopped and one taken under a full mix are different claims. A single session average silently
// blends them in whatever ratio the operator happened to play, so every number below is binned by
// whether the transport was running.
//
// ⚠️ **THE CALLBACK GAP IS SDL-ONLY.** `SdlAudioEngine::audioCallback` calls it; Oboe's callback does
// not, because `oboe-audio-engine.cpp` is below `shell/` and cannot see this header. Android's gap rows
// are therefore empty — its output figure comes through the seam instead, which is the one term of the
// two that Oboe can report better than this header could measure it.
//
//   SPRITESTEP_LATENCY=1   accumulate, and print the account on exit
//
// Off by default and free when off: one cached bool ahead of every store.
