// midi-out-android.{h,cpp} — the ANDROID implementation of songcore::IMidiOut (MIDI plan phase B2b).
//
// The third and last of the backends (§4.3 / §4.5): Windows = winmm, Linux = ALSA rawmidi, **Android
// = MidiManager, reached by JNI**. Nothing above `IMidiOut` is per-platform — the serializer, the note
// lifecycle, the release queue and the 0–255 → 0–127 scaling are native/songcore/midi_out.h and are
// shared by all three; the console half (device list, spec resolver, TEST, trace, counters, the
// 16-channel panic before a close) is midi-out-base.{h,cpp}. This file is five JNI calls.
//
// ── ⚠️⚠️ THIS ADDS A KOTLIN FILE BACK, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE DECISION, NOT AN OVERSIGHT ────────
//
// Convergence Phase E deleted ~35.3k lines of Kotlin and left `app/src/main/java` a four-file shim.
// This makes it five (`platform/android/MidiOutManager.kt`), and the MIDI plan named the cost when it
// was ratified rather than discovering it here. The reason it is unavoidable:
//
//   • `android.media.midi.MidiManager` is the ONLY sanctioned route to USB, virtual and BLE MIDI
//     devices on Android. It is a Java API.
//   • The NDK's **AMidi** C API does not remove the Java half: it is API 29+ (this app's floor is 26)
//     AND it still requires a Java-side `MidiManager` to enumerate and open the device — it only
//     makes the byte I/O native, which is the part that was never the problem.
//   • Raw `UsbManager` bulk transfers would mean hand-writing the USB-MIDI class driver, and would
//     lose virtual (app-to-app) devices and BLE entirely.
//
// So this is the same shape `ButtonFeedback` already has and for the same reason — an Android system
// service with no C++ twin, reached through one narrow outward hook — not a retreat from convergence.
// It costs portability nothing: per-platform MIDI I/O is unavoidable everywhere (Linux = ALSA,
// Windows = winmm, macOS = CoreMIDI), and `IMidiOut` IS the portability.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE DIRECTION GOTCHA, which is the easiest thing in this file to get backwards ────────────
//
// **To SEND MIDI you open the device's INPUT port.** The names are written from the DEVICE's point of
// view: a synth you play has an input port, a keyboard you play FROM has an output port. So the list
// this backend must show is `inputPortCount > 0` — devices that can RECEIVE — and a MIDI keyboard
// correctly does not appear on it. Getting this backwards lists exactly the wrong devices, and the
// symptom is "the port opens and the synth is silent", not an error. It is the exact mirror of the
// ALSA backend's `SND_RAWMIDI_STREAM_OUTPUT` filter; both are in one place each, and both are
// commented, because neither can be caught by a test that does not have hardware attached.
//
// ── THREADING ⚠️ CORRECTED BY MIDI PLAN B3 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This note used to read "every method here runs on the SDL thread (the frame loop)". **That was true
// when it was written and B3 invalidated it** — the guardrails' recurring shape exactly: an assumption
// true when made, broken by the layer built on top, in a channel nothing was pointed at. Today:
//
//   • `send` runs on the MIDI SENDER THREAD for anything the clock releases (shell/midi-sender.cpp),
//     and on the FRAME LOOP for a panic's immediate note-offs. Two threads, serialised by
//     `ExternalConsumer`'s mutex — and `MidiOutManager.send` is `@Synchronized` as well, so the Kotlin
//     side's one reusable byte buffer does not depend on a C++ lock it cannot see.
//   • `device_count` / `device_name` / `open` / `close` still run on the frame loop only (a port pick,
//     boot, teardown).
//
// ⚠️ **THE SENDER THREAD IS AN `SDL_CreateThread` THREAD FOR THE SAKE OF THIS FILE.** A native thread
// must be attached to the JVM before any JNI call; SDL's thread entry calls `Android_JNI_SetupThread()`,
// which attaches it and registers the detach on exit. A raw `std::thread` would work perfectly on
// Windows and Linux and abort the VM here.
//
// `MidiInputPort.send` is safe from any thread. The one method that blocks is `open`:
// `MidiManager.openDevice` is ASYNCHRONOUS and the Kotlin side waits on a latch for it (bounded, ~3 s),
// so a port pick can stall the frame loop briefly. That is a deliberate trade — see MidiOutManager.kt,
// which explains why the alternative (an optimistic `true`) would make the OUTPUT row lie about which
// cable is live.
//
// Every method id is resolved BY NAME, so a missing Kotlin side degrades to "no devices" with one log
// line rather than a crash — and R8 must not rename them: see app/proguard-rules.pro.
