// ─── shell/portrait2.{h,cpp} — the PORTRAIT2 device-skin RENDERER (convergence D) ─────────────────
//
// The shell half of the retro-device skin: on a phone held in portrait, the 640×480 tracker sits in a
// bezel with a ventilation panel above it, a branding strip below, and a themed button cluster filling
// the bottom — 20:9 chrome drawn AROUND the letterboxed frame, exactly as `PortraitLayout2WithVirtual‐
// Buttons` (ScreenLayouts.kt) + `VirtualControlsPortrait2` (VirtualControls.kt) do on Android today.
//
// It is the consumer the host-tested geometry was written for. `touch_layout::portrait2_skin` computes
// the four band rects + the frame-in-bezel (checked by `pttouch --positions`); this file COMPOSITES
// them: it clears to the casing colour, blits each band's PNG (from `Skin`, decoded once), tells
// `SdlVideo` where the frame goes, and draws the ten buttons on the backing. The split is convergence
// D1's: the ARITHMETIC is shared, portable, golden/oracle-checked C++; the PIXELS are shell-side, and
// this is the shell.
//
//   ┌───────────────┐  band 1  top vent panel   (SkinPiece::TopPanel)      — may be absent (case C)
//   │  ┌─────────┐  │  band 2  screen bezel      (SkinPiece::ScreenBezel)   — the 640×480 frame sits INSIDE
//   │  │ 640×480 │  │
//   ├──┴─────────┴──┤  band 3  branding strip    (SkinPiece::BrandingPanel) — FULL device width
//   │  [buttons...]  │  band 4  button cluster    (SkinPiece::ButtonBacking) — the ten portrait2_rects
//   └───────────────┘
//
// ── THREE SKINS IN ONE RENDERER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The above is the CHROME art (amiga / amiga-2). A skin whose `SkinArt` in device_skin.h is anything
// else is drawn by this same class from a different starting point: `portrait2_skin_bare` instead of
// `portrait2_skin`, so there are no bands at all — just the tracker across the FULL device width and
// the button cluster below it. Both such skins tint their art at blit time to the live tracker theme,
// so two colours reach the screen: the theme's background, which is the casing clear, and its TXT
// VALUE, which is every key. They differ only in what the art is and therefore whether text goes over
// it — BITMAP ships a character per button and needs none; TRANSPARENT ships the bare square and wide
// shapes and gets the same labels the chrome skins draw, in that same TXT VALUE.
//
//   ┌───────────────┐  the tracker — full device width, no bezel, no border
//   │    640×480    │
//   ├───────────────┤
//   │  [buttons...]  │  the same cluster, the same `portrait2_rects`, the same hit-test
//   └───────────────┘
//
// The CLUSTER arithmetic is shared, which is the point: only the bands around it differ, so a button
// is in the same place relative to its neighbours under either skin and `SdlTouch` needs to know
// nothing about which one is up.
//
// The buttons are hit-testable. `PortraitSkin` exposes the cluster rect + the ten box-local button rects
// (`cluster_rect()` / `button_rects()`) — the SAME geometry it draws — and `SdlTouch::layout_portrait2`
// hit-tests them, feeding fingers through `SdlInput`'s own press/release exactly as the landscape panels
// do. Drawing stays HERE; only the finger→Button mapping is SdlTouch's, so there is one source of truth
// for where a button is and a press can never highlight a cell the finger is not on.
