//
// Only the audio backend gets an interface (`audio-backend.h`), because it is the one thing already
// known to differ and already written twice. The other three axes convergence-plan C0.2 names — the
// lifecycle source, root resolution, asset access — are NOT modelled yet, on purpose:
//
//   • **root resolution and the filesystem need no new seam.** `pt::ui::FileSystem` has been an
//     abstract interface since S6a, so `run()` takes one and the platform decides what to pass. That
//     is exactly the seam convergence-plan C5's spike is about: if `std::filesystem` works on
//     `/storage/emulated/0` Android passes the same `StdFileSystem`, and if it does not, it passes
//     its own — with nothing in this file changing either way.
//   • **the lifecycle source is one nullable callback** (`terminate_requested`), not a hierarchy.
//     Desktop polls its SIGTERM flag through it. ⚠️ Android will NOT: SDL freezes the native thread
//     when the activity pauses, so a flag consumed by this loop is P4d's never-armed write in a new
//     body — C4's autosave has to flush in an `SDL_AddEventWatch` watcher, which runs on the Java
//     activity thread and never touches this loop at all. Modelling that now would mean designing an
//     interface for a caller that does not exist, against a freezing behaviour nothing here has yet
//     observed. The hook is where it will plug in; the shape is C4's to choose.
//   • **asset access** has no consumer until Phase D's skins and overlays.
//
// The rule this follows is the one the guardrails keep paying for: an assumption that is true when
// it is made and invalidated by the layer built on top of it. Two of these three have no layer on top
// of them yet, so there is nothing to be right about.
