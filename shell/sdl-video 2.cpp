    // compute the SAME rect when the output is exactly the design size, so the setting genuinely had
    // nothing to do. Making the window resizable is what gives that setting somewhere to show.
    //
    // ⚠️ The size is DERIVED from the display rather than hardcoded to 2×, and that is what makes one
    // code path correct on three very different targets with no build-time discriminator to test —
    // and there is none: desktop Linux and PortMaster are the same Linux build of the same main.cpp.

    // Hardcoding 2× would have overflowed every handheld panel in the zoo, which is exactly the
    // "frame is LARGER than the display" case describe() warns about.

    // The 90% margin is for the things a desktop puts around a window and a handheld does not: a

    // the UI already fills its own background with makes the whole window read as one surface, which
    // is the "fullscreen experience" this is for.

    // ⚠️ It is the LIVE theme, so it tracks the theme editor and any loaded .ptt with no wiring of its
    // own — the colour arrives as an argument on every present (see the header for why not a setter).
    //
    // ⚠️ Phase D composites the touch skin into exactly this space on a phone. That is not a conflict:

    // underneath them, and remains the whole answer on every layout that has no virtual buttons.

    // `scrimBounds`, with the SAME colour — never the frame itself. The bounds are what keep this correct
    // on both present paths: LANDSCAPE passes the whole output, so the scrim reaches the letterbox bars;
    // PORTRAIT2 passes the bezel's inner GLASS (present_skinned), so with INTEGER scaling — where the frame
    // is a whole multiple SMALLER than the glass — the bright gap around it dims too, while the device
    // casing and the button cluster OUTSIDE the glass stay bright (dimming those reads as a bug, not a
    // modal). An earlier draft filled the whole output and let the frame copy reclaim the 4:3 area, but the
