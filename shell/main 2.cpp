// SPRITESTEP — the DESKTOP/HANDHELD entry point. Everything in this file is platform residue.
//
// Convergence C0.2 split the old 771-line main.cpp in two. The boot sequence, the frame loop and the
// teardown were portable orchestration and moved to `app.{h,cpp}`, which every platform shares; what
// is left here is the small, nameable remainder that genuinely is not:
//
//   • the COMMAND LINE — a desktop and a PortMaster launch script have one; an APK does not;
//   • the SIGNAL HANDLER — POSIX. Android's lifecycle arrives as `SDL_APP_*` events instead (C4);
//   • `SDL_Init` and `SDL_Quit` — Android's `SDLActivity` owns its own;
//   • the AUDIO BACKEND — `SdlAudioEngine` here, `OboeAudioEngine` there (C3, audio-backend.h);
//   • the ROOT and the FILESYSTEM — `default_app_root()` + `StdFileSystem`. C5 decides Android's;
//   • the CAPS profile, and whether there is a console to print a banner to.
//
// That is the whole list, and it is the point of the split: convergence C1–C4 add a second file
// beside this one rather than forking the tracker.
//
// Everything that decides how a song SOUNDS — the sequencer, effect resolution, the voices, the whole
// DSP chain — is the same C++ the APK ships, linked from native/ and reached through one class:
//
//     songcore::SongcoreHost          (native/songcore/host.h)
//
// which is the same class songcore-jni.cpp marshals for Android. Since Phase 3, everything that
// decides how the app LOOKS is shared too — `pt-ui` (native/ui/) draws the screens into a 640×480
// framebuffer and knows nothing about SDL.

// ─── SIGTERM / SIGINT — the launcher taking the process back (S10) ────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠️⚠️ **THE HANDLER SETS A FLAG. IT DOES NOTHING ELSE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE OF THE DESIGN.**
//
// The port plan says "handle SIGINT/SIGTERM → autosave" (§5), and read literally — serialize the
// project from inside the handler — it is a bug of exactly the kind the autosave exists to prevent.
// A signal handler may only call async-signal-safe functions. Writing a .ptp is ~440 KB of JSON
// through `malloc`, `<filesystem>` and `ofstream`, and not one of those is on the list: a SIGTERM
// landing while the main thread happens to be inside `malloc` deadlocks the handler on the heap lock.
// The app HANGS instead of saving, the launcher's SIGKILL arrives a second later, and the autosave has
// failed in precisely the case it was written for. Writing to a `volatile sig_atomic_t` is the one
// thing the standard actually promises here, so it is the only thing this does. The frame loop reads
// the flag through `AppConfig::terminate_requested`, leaves, and flushes on the main thread with the
// heap intact.
//
// ⚠️ **AND IT IS OURS, NOT SDL's — WHICH IS NOT WHAT S10 FIRST ASSUMED.** SDL_quit.c installs handlers
// for SIGINT and SIGTERM that do exactly this (`send_quit_pending = SDL_TRUE`; its own comment says
// *"We can't send it in signal handler; SDL_malloc() might be interrupted!"*), and it was tempting to
// call the job done and write nothing. **Measured, and it is not done:**
//
//   • on WINDOWS the whole thing is `#ifdef HAVE_SIGNAL_H`, and SDL's generated config carries
//     `/* #undef HAVE_SIGNAL_H */` — so `SDL_EventSignal_Init` compiles to NOTHING. A scratch harness
//     raising SIGTERM after `SDL_Init` found the disposition still `SIG_DFL`, and the raise went
//     straight to the CRT default: `abort()`, exit code 3. No handler, no quit event, no autosave.
//   • on LINUX it IS compiled in — but it is *also* gated on `SDL_HINT_NO_SIGNAL_HANDLERS`, which is
//     readable from the ENVIRONMENT (`SDL_NO_SIGNAL_HANDLERS=1`). Whether a launcher kill saves the
//     user's song would then depend on an env var in somebody else's launch script.
//
// So the guarantee would have rested on how a third party's SDL was compiled and on a variable we do
// not own — for the one path in the app whose failure mode is *losing the user's work*. Ten lines are
// cheaper than that. ⚠️ SDL will not fight us for it: `SDL_EventSignal_Init` puts back any handler it
// finds that is not `SIG_DFL`, so installing before `SDL_Init` leaves ours in place.
