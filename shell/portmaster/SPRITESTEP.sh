# SPRITESTEP - PortMaster launch script.
#
# =============================================================================================
#  DO NOT ADD gptokeyb TO THIS FILE.
# =============================================================================================
#
# It looks like an omission. Every other port has it. It is deliberate, and adding it back
# reintroduces a bug that took a device session to find.
#
# gptokeyb exists to fake KEYBOARD presses for games that cannot read a gamepad. SPRITESTEP
# reads the pad itself, through SDL's GameController API (shell/sdl-input.cpp), and it ALSO reads
# the keyboard, because the same source builds the desktop dev binary. So with gptokeyb running,
# every physical press arrives TWICE by two different paths - and gptokeyb's built-in defaults do
# not agree with the app's keyboard map about what the buttons mean:
#
#     gptokeyb default   ->  sdl-input.cpp key_to_button  ->  what the user gets
#     start = enter          SDLK_RETURN  -> Button::A        START also inserts a chain, AND
#                                                             (A now counting as held) the !m.a
#                                                             guard in main.cpp swallows START,
#                                                             so playback will not stop
#     y = a                  SDLK_a       -> DPAD_LEFT        Y also walks the cursor left
#     r1 = leftshift         SDLK_LSHIFT  -> SELECT           R1 also holds SELECT, and R+DPAD is
#                                                             the nav-grid gesture
#     left_analog = wasd     w/a/s/d      -> the D-pad        a drifting stick moves the cursor
#
# The D-pad collision is invisible (SdlInput::press ignores a button already held, so the pad's
# own DPAD_UP absorbs the injected Up), which is why only the START symptom was ever reported.
# There is no gptokeyb mode that injects nothing - PortMaster's own docs confirm it - so the only
# fix is not to run it.
#
# Quitting is the app's own job and always was: PROJECT -> EXIT (it asks first if the song is
# dirty), and a SIGTERM from the launcher is caught and autosaved either way (Phase 3 S10).

# The app's six folders (Projects/ Samples/ Soundfonts/ Instruments/ Renders/ Themes/) are created

# The shell opens SDL GameControllers, so the pad needs a mapping or SDL_IsGameController() is false
# and nothing responds. There are TWO channels for that, and measuring on a Miyoo Flip (spruce) showed
# which one is load-bearing:
#
#   - SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG_FILE, which PortMaster's control.txt exports (a path to its bundled
#     gamecontrollerdb.txt). THIS is what maps the pad here, together with SDL's own built-in db.
#   - SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG (a single inline mapping string), exported below from get_controls'
#     $sdl_controllerconfig.
#
# ⚠️ On spruce that variable is EMPTY: get_controls() has its assignment commented out, so this export
# is a no-op. It is kept anyway because it is harmless (an empty value adds no mapping) and other CFWs
# DO populate it, and PortMaster's porting guide has ports export it. What it is NOT is "the thing that
# makes the pad work" — the file channel is. Confirmed by the app's own boot log: a bare run reports
# `controller: X360 Controller` (SDL's built-in name), while under the launcher it reports
# `Xbox 360 Controller` (the name in PortMaster's db) — two names, so the file mapping is in force.
export SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG="$sdl_controllerconfig"

# No LD_LIBRARY_PATH and no libs.aarch64: this port deliberately links the DEVICE's libSDL2, which
# is the copy patched for its display (KMSDRM) and audio (ALSA). Shipping our own would override
# the one that knows the hardware. The binary needs SDL >= 2.0.18 (it calls SDL_GetTicks64); every
# current Tier-1 CFW is well past that.

# The zip ships the binary mode 0755, and harbourmaster preserves that when it installs from
# autoinstall/. A hand-unzip is what loses it: Windows Explorer and the default 7-Zip extraction drop
# the Unix mode word entirely, and the port then dies with "Permission denied" on a file that looks
# perfectly present. Repaired here rather than documented, because by the time this script runs the
# user has already done the copy. It cannot repair its own bit — that is what autoinstall is for.
#
# A no-op on the common case, and a failure on a vfat/exFAT card is expected and harmless: those
# mounts have no permission bits and hand out +x by mount option.
