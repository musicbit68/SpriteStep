# SPRITESTEP

A music tracker for handhelds — the same tracker as the Android app, built from the same C++.
The sequencer, the sample engine, the DSP and every screen are shared source; only the window,
the audio device and the input come from SDL.

## Controls

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| D-pad | Move the cursor |
| A | Edit / confirm / open the thing under the cursor |
| A + D-pad | Change the value under the cursor (up/down = fine, left/right = coarse) |
| B | Back / close |
| A + B | Delete the value under the cursor |
| B + D-pad | Cycle the item under the cursor (chain, phrase, instrument…) |
| A, A | Double-tap to insert a new item |
| R + D-pad | Move between screens — this is how you get everywhere |
| L | Selection and clipboard modifier (L+A cut/paste, L+B+A clone) |
| SELECT | The screen's context action (SELECT+A renames a file in the browser) |
| START | Play / stop |

There is no exit hotkey: quit from **PROJECT → EXIT**. It asks first if the song has unsaved
changes. If the launcher or a flat battery kills the app instead, the work is autosaved and
offered back the next time you start.

## Your files

Everything lives in the port's own `data/` folder, on the SD card:

```
ports/spritestep/data/
├── Projects/      your songs (.ptp)
├── Samples/       .wav .mp3 .flac .ogg .opus
├── Soundfonts/    .sf2
├── Instruments/   saved instrument presets (.pti)
├── Themes/        colour themes (.ptt)
└── Renders/       WAV mixes and stems you bounce
```

The folders are created the first time you launch, so you can pull the card and drop files
straight in. The layout is the same one the Android app uses inside its home folder, so a folder
copied off a phone works as-is.

## Requirements

`aarch64` CFW with SDL2 **2.0.18 or newer**. No BIOS, no runtime, no extra downloads.

## Notes

The port uses the device's own SDL2 rather than shipping one, so it renders and plays through the
libraries your CFW patched for its screen and audio hardware.
