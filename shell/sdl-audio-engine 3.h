// sdl-audio-engine.{h,cpp} — the SDL2 audio backend.
//
// The desktop/handheld twin of oboe-audio-engine.{h,cpp}, and deliberately its mirror image: open a
// stereo float stream, hand each device buffer straight to AudioEngine::processLiveBlock(), own
// nothing else. Every sample of DSP, all scheduling, the offline-render gate, the scope/spectrum
// capture — all of it lives in the portable core. audio-engine.h's header comment named this file
// before it existed ("a future ALSA/JACK/SDL2 backend is a parallel file that calls
// processLiveBlock() the same way"), and native/CMakeLists.txt's ANDROID_PLATFORM_SOURCES describes
// the swap: the Linux port replaces exactly the Oboe/JNI shell and keeps everything above it.
//
// ⚠️ NO DSP MAY EVER BE ADDED HERE. Same rule as onAudioReady: this is glue, not signal path.
