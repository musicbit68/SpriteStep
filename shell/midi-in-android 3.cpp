// midi-in-android.{h,cpp} — the ANDROID implementation of songcore::IMidiIn (MIDI plan phase E5).
//
// The third and last backend, and the mirror of midi-out-android.cpp in every way but one. Everything
// above `IMidiIn` — the byte ring, the parser, the channel→track→instrument router, the injection into
// the engine — is native/songcore/midi_in.h and is shared with Windows and Linux; the sink, the device
// list and the counters are midi-in-base.{h,cpp}. This file is five JNI calls.
//
// The Java half is unavoidable for the reasons MidiOutManager.kt sets out and this direction does not
// change: `android.media.midi.MidiManager` is the only sanctioned route to USB, virtual and BLE MIDI on
// Android, the NDK's AMidi is API 29+ (this app's floor is 26) and still needs the Java side to
// enumerate and open, and raw `UsbManager` would mean hand-writing the USB-MIDI class driver.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE DIRECTION GOTCHA, and it is the OPPOSITE of the output backend's ──────────────────────
//
// **To RECEIVE MIDI you open the device's OUTPUT port.** Port names are written from the DEVICE's point
// of view: a keyboard you play FROM has an output port, a synth you play has an input port. So the list
// this backend shows is `outputPortCount > 0` — devices that can SEND — where midi-out-android.cpp
// asks for `inputPortCount > 0`. Getting either backwards produces a list of exactly the wrong devices
// and a port that opens and stays silent, which reads as a broken app rather than a wrong list. The two
// filters are one line each, in one file each, both commented, because neither can be caught by a test
// without hardware attached — the ALSA pair (STREAM_INPUT/STREAM_OUTPUT) at least has `tools/ptalsain`.
//
// ── ⚠️⚠️ THIS BACKEND IS POLLED, AND THE OTHER TWO PUSH. WHY. ────────────────────────────────────
//
// winmm calls us on its own callback thread and ALSA gets a reader thread of ours; both hand bytes to
// `MidiInBase::deliver` the moment they exist. Android's `MidiReceiver.onSend` arrives on a binder
// thread, and the obvious mirror would be a Kotlin `external fun` calling down into C++ from there.
// This does the opposite — `pump()` on the frame loop asks Kotlin for whatever has arrived — and the
// reasons are, in order:
//
//   1. ⭐ **IT COSTS NOTHING IN LATENCY, which is the argument that decides it.** The bytes a push would
//      deposit in `MidiInQueue` are not looked at until `SongcoreHost::poll()` drains them, and that is
//      once a frame. `pump()` is called from the same loop, immediately before that drain — so a byte
//      that arrives at any point in a frame is parsed in the same frame either way. A push would move
//      the same byte to a different waiting room.
//   2. **It keeps the JNI direction single.** Every native↔Kotlin call in this app is an UP-call
//      resolved by name, with one `-keep` pattern in proguard-rules.pro protecting all of them and one
//      "hooks resolved" log line saying whether R8 broke them. A `native` method declared in Kotlin is a
//      different mechanism with a different R8 failure mode — and release-only JNI-by-name breakage is
//      exactly the bug class that killed every render in the first v0.9.3 APK.
//   3. **Lifetime.** A binder thread calling into a C++ object owned by the frame loop needs that
//      object to outlive every in-flight call; here nothing on the Java side holds a native pointer at
//      all, so a close is a close.
//
// The cost is stated rather than hidden: while SDL freezes the native thread (the activity is paused),
// nothing pumps, and MidiInManager's ring fills and then drops the newest bytes — see its own note. It
// counts them and logs the total.
//
// ── THREADING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every method here runs on the SDL thread (the frame loop): `pump` from the loop, the other four from
// a device pick or from boot. `MidiInManager` is `@Synchronized` on the Kotlin side because ITS ring is
// filled from a binder thread — so the lock that matters is the one over there, next to the data it
// protects, rather than a rule this file would have to remember.
//
// Every method id is resolved BY NAME, so a missing Kotlin side degrades to "no devices" with one log
// line rather than a crash — and R8 must not rename them: see app/proguard-rules.pro.
