// alsa-rawmidi.{h,cpp} — the ONE libasound loader and the ONE rawmidi enumerator on Linux.
//
// Shared by `AlsaMidiOut` (MIDI plan B2b) and `AlsaMidiIn` (E5), and shared for the reason the
// guardrails keep charging this project for: the dlopen boilerplate and the card→device walk are
// IDENTICAL for the two directions — they differ by one integer, `STREAM_OUTPUT` vs `STREAM_INPUT` —
// so written twice they are two things that can disagree about which devices exist, and one of the
// two copies is the one nobody looks at again. Written once, the only per-direction fact left is the
// constant, which is exactly the fact `ptalsa` pins against ALSA's own headers.
//
// ⚠️ **THE PROTOTYPES BELOW ARE HAND-COPIED AND NOTHING IN A NORMAL BUILD CHECKS THEM.** That is the
// price of dlopen (midi-out-alsa.cpp argues why dlopen rather than `-lasound`: the PortMaster build
// container has no libasound-dev, and a link-time dependency turns a CFW without the library into an
// app that will not start). A mis-copied C signature still compiles, still links, and corrupts the
// stack at runtime on a device that is not on this desk — so `tools/ptalsa` includes the REAL
// <alsa/asoundlib.h>, assigns the real functions into this struct and static_asserts the rest.
// ⭐ **RUN IT AFTER TOUCHING THIS LIST**, and note that it also asserts the FIELD COUNT: a field added
// here and not covered there fails the check by construction rather than passing in silence.
