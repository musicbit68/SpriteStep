// sdl-input.{h,cpp} — raw SDL input → the virtual button model.
//
// The source half of input/ButtonHandlers.kt's `InputMapper`: it turns keyboard and gamepad events
// into presses and releases of the ten buttons the app actually knows about, and it owns the custom
// key repeat. What it deliberately does NOT do is decide what a button MEANS — the combo matrix
// (A+DPAD edits, B+DPAD cycles the item, L+B selection, R+DPAD screen navigation, the A,A double-tap,
// the press-vs-release deferral) is `ui/button_mapper.h`, and what a meaning DOES is
// `ui/input_dispatcher.h`. Splitting there is not a shortcut: THIS half — a keycode, a game-controller
// button, an axis — is the only part of the input chain that is platform-specific, and it is the only
// part left in this directory.
//
// ⚠️ The button model itself (`Button`, `ButtonMods`, `ButtonEvent`) was declared HERE until
// convergence C0.1 and now lives in `ui/buttons.h`, because none of those four types ever named an
// SDL type — see that header for why "a ButtonEvent is an SDL-side type" was a fact about this file
// rather than about the design, and what it was costing.
//
// The keyboard map is copied from the Kotlin one exactly (WASD/arrows, K/Enter = A, J/Esc = B, U/I =
// shoulders, LShift = SELECT, Space = START), so a dev's muscle memory transfers between the two
// builds and a bug report about "the K key" means the same thing on both.
