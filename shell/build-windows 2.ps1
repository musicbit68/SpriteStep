# Build the Windows desktop package: build/windows/SPRITESTEP-<version>-windows-x64.zip
#
# Convergence plan A3. Run from the repo root, after building the shell:
#
#     cmake -S shell -B shell/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
#     cmake --build shell/build --config Release
#     powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File shell/build-windows.ps1
#
# This script PACKAGES, it does not build — unlike build-portmaster.sh, whose container owns its
# whole toolchain. Here the compiler lives behind vcvars64.bat in whatever Visual Studio the machine
# happens to have, and a packaging script that tried to find it would be guessing. It fails loudly
# if the exe is missing or older than the sources instead.
#
# ⚠️ Nothing here is filtered down to the word "error". Every check prints what it actually found,
# not a verdict — this project has been burned by a "PASS" printed by a check whose two inputs had
# both failed and compared equal.
#
# ⚠️ SDL2 IS INSIDE THE EXE, and that is the difference from the PortMaster package that matters
# most here. A handheld links the CFW's own libSDL2 and ships none; a Windows box has no system SDL
# at all, so shell/CMakeLists.txt falls through to FetchContent and links it statically. That makes
# this zip a binary distribution of SDL2 and puts its notice in the artifact — see the SDL2 section
# of licenses/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md, which said the opposite until this package existed.
