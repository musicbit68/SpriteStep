// ─── shell/assets.h — the ASSET SEAM (convergence plan D7) ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// Skins, overlays and (later) the demo project ship as files the shell has to read at run time, and
// WHERE they live is the one thing that genuinely differs between the two worlds this shell runs in:
//
//   * Android — they are packed inside the APK's `assets/`, which `std::filesystem` cannot see at all
//     (there is no path on disk; they are entries in a zip the loader mmaps). SDL's own `SDL_RWFromFile`
//     is the only thing here that reads them: on Android a path with no leading slash is looked up in
//     the APK's AAssetManager by SDL's Android RWops, so the relative path is used verbatim.
//   * Desktop / handheld — they sit beside the executable on a real filesystem. There `SDL_RWFromFile`
//     is `fopen`, which resolves against the process's CWD (whatever a launcher last cd'd to), NOT
//     where the resources are — so the path is anchored to `SDL_GetBasePath()`, the exe's directory.
//
// That fork — and it is the WHOLE fork — lives behind this one function, which is exactly the point of
// naming the seam: `image.{h,cpp}` decode bytes and know nothing of where they came from, `skin.{h,cpp}`
// composite textures and know nothing either, and only this file knows which world it is in. The
// header note in `image.h` already anticipated this: `decode_png(bytes)` is fed from here.
