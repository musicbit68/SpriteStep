/**
 * **Is this input device a real game controller?** The single decision behind `MainActivity`'s
 * `hasPhysicalGameButtons()`, which the shared C++ shell asks over JNI once at boot and again on every
 * controller add/remove to choose between the touch UI (on-screen gamepad + PORTRAIT2 skin) and FULL,
 * the bare fullscreen frame with no on-screen buttons.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A WRONG `true` LOCKS A PHONE USER OUT OF THE APP ENTIRELY.** FULL draws no buttons, so a
 * touchscreen device that is wrongly believed to have a pad has no working input at all — not even
 * enough to reach SETTINGS and change the layout. A wrong `false` is merely cosmetic by comparison: a
 * handheld that also has buttons gets the touch skin, and its buttons keep working. **When a test here
 * is a judgement call, it goes the way that leaves input reachable.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE `sources` BITMASK IS NOT ENOUGH — SOME PHONES CLAIM `GAMEPAD | JOYSTICK` ON A DEVICE THAT
 * IS NOT ONE.** Android's `EventHub` classes any evdev node carrying keys in the `BTN_MISC..BTN_MOUSE`
 * range (`BTN_0`…`BTN_9`) as a gamepad, and having decided that, calls it a joystick too. Xiaomi's
 * fingerprint reader (`uinput-fpc`; `uinput-goodixfp` is the Goodix part other vendors fit) declares
 * exactly those keys for its navigation gestures, so on a Redmi 10C it arrives as `sources=0x1000511`
 * — gamepad, joystick AND keyboard — on a phone with no buttons anywhere.
 *
 * The split between [classify] the pure function and [classify] the `InputDevice` overload is what
 * makes the policy testable off-device: everything Android-shaped is gathered by the overload, and
 * every rule lives below it in plain data.
