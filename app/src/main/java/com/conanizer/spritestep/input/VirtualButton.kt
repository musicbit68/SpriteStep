/**
 * VirtualButton - the unified "virtual gamepad" every input source maps to.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Order is load-bearing and matches `pt::ui::Button` (native/ui/buttons.h) exactly.** The shell
 * passes a virtual button across JNI as its ORDINAL, and `MainActivity.onButtonFeedback` is the one
 * place that turns it back into an enum (`VirtualButton.entries[ordinal]`) before handing it to the
 * sound and haptic managers, which take the enum and never see the number. So a reorder here — or in
 * `Button` — silently mis-maps every button click, and nothing on either side would report it.
 *
 * The button LOGIC is all C++; only the two feedback managers still need this enum on the Kotlin side.
