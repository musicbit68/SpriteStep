/**
 * The Android MIDI **output** port — the Java half of `songcore::IMidiOut` (MIDI plan phase B2b).
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Why this file exists at all, when Phase E deleted the Kotlin UI
 *
 * Convergence left `app/src/main/java` a four-file shim; this is the fifth, and the MIDI plan named
 * the cost when it was ratified rather than discovering it here. `android.media.midi.MidiManager` is
 * the **only** sanctioned route to USB, virtual and BLE MIDI devices on Android, and it is a Java
 * API. The NDK's AMidi does not save us: it is API 29+ (this app's floor is 26) and it *still*
 * requires Java-side `MidiManager` to enumerate and open a device — it only makes the byte I/O
 * native, which was never the part that needed help. Raw `UsbManager` bulk transfers would mean
 * hand-writing the USB-MIDI class driver and would lose virtual (app-to-app) devices entirely.
 *
 * So this is the same shape [ButtonSoundManager] and [ButtonHapticManager] already have: an Android
 * system service with no C++ twin, reached through one narrow outward hook. Everything above it —
 * the serializer, the note lifecycle, the gate lengths, the panic, the OFFSET — is C++ and is shared
 * with the Windows and Linux builds. Nothing musical is decided here.
 *
 * ## ⚠️⚠️ THE DIRECTION GOTCHA — the easiest thing in this file to get backwards
 *
 * **To SEND MIDI you open the device's INPUT port.** Port names are written from the *device's* point
 * of view: a synth you play *has* an input; a keyboard you play *from* has an output. So the list this
 * class exposes is `inputPortCount > 0` — devices that can RECEIVE — and a MIDI keyboard correctly
 * does not appear on it. Backwards, this lists exactly the wrong devices and the symptom is "the port
 * opened and the synth is silent", which reads as a sequencer bug rather than a port one.
 *
 * ## Threading
 *
 * Every method is called from the **SDL thread** (the native frame loop), never the UI thread.
 * `MidiInputPort.send` is safe from any thread. [open] BLOCKS that thread — see its own note.
