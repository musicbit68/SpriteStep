/**
 * The Android MIDI **input** port — the Java half of `songcore::IMidiIn` (MIDI plan phase E5).
 *
 * The mirror of [MidiOutManager], written for the same unavoidable reason: `MidiManager` is the only
 * sanctioned route to USB, virtual and BLE MIDI on Android and it is a Java API (AMidi is API 29+, this
 * app's floor is 26, and it still needs the Java side to enumerate and open). Everything above it — the
 * MIDI 1.0 parser, the channel→track map, which instrument a live key plays, whether the key goes back
 * out on the cable — is C++ and is shared with the Windows and Linux builds. Nothing musical is
 * decided here.
 *
 * ## ⚠️⚠️ THE DIRECTION GOTCHA — and it is the OPPOSITE of [MidiOutManager]'s
 *
 * **To RECEIVE MIDI you open the device's OUTPUT port.** Port names are written from the *device's*
 * point of view: a keyboard you play FROM has an output; a synth you play HAS an input. So the list
 * this class exposes is `outputPortCount > 0` — devices that can SEND — where [MidiOutManager] asks for
 * `inputPortCount > 0`. Backwards, this offers the user's synth as something to play from, and the
 * symptom is a port that opens and never delivers a byte: a wrong list, never an error.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Threading, and the one lock in this file
 *
 * [onSend] arrives on a **binder thread** owned by the MIDI service. Everything else ([deviceCount],
 * [deviceName], [open], [close], [read]) is called from the **SDL thread** (the native frame loop).
 * Those two meet at [ring], and that is the only thing `@Synchronized` here protects. The C++ side
 * holds no lock of its own for this, deliberately: the lock lives next to the data it protects rather
 * than in a language that cannot see it — the same argument [MidiOutManager.send] carries since B3.
