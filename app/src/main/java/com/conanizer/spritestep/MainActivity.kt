/**
 * SPRITESTEP's Android entry point: an `SDLActivity` subclass. Convergence Phase E.
 *
 * This is the whole of the Android-only surface now. The ~15,000-line Compose UI, the input
 * dispatcher and the JNI audio facade are gone, replaced by the shared C++ SDL shell (`shell/`,
 * `native/ui/`) that already drives Windows and the Linux handhelds. All this class still does is the
 * handful of jobs that are genuinely Java's: point SDL at the native libraries and the two roots, own
 * the splash screen and the immersive / edge-to-edge window, serve the Storage Access Framework (the
 * folder picker and the twelve [SafStorage] delegates), run the one-shot SharedPreferences → settings.json
 * import, and route button feedback (sound/haptics) back from the shell over one JNI hook.
 *
 * ⚠️ **It asks for NO permission, and the manifest declares none but `VIBRATE`.** Storage is a folder
 * the user grants from the system picker; see the manifest's own note for why adding one back would
 * buy nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ It began life as `SdlActivity` in `src/debug/` — the second, debug-only activity the app carried
 * beside Compose through phases C and D, so touch could be developed without breaking the shipped UI
 * (see docs/internal/convergence-plan.md §5–7 and the git history at tag `kotlin-ui-final`). Phase E
 * deleted the Compose `MainActivity` and moved this class into `src/main/` under that name. Inline
 * comments below that cite `MainActivity.kt:<line>` refer to that now-deleted Compose activity as the
 * prior art each behaviour was learned from.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The system bars are Java's, so they are below; the lifecycle is NOT** — the autosave/settings
 * flush is a `SDL_AddEventWatch` watcher in `shell/app.cpp`,
 * shared with every other platform, because `SDL_APP_WILLENTERBACKGROUND` fires on the NATIVE thread
 * inside the frame loop's own `SDL_PollEvent` — not on this thread. The back button is likewise
 * split: the hint is armed in `shell/android-main.cpp` and the key is mapped in `shell/sdl-input.cpp`.
 * Nothing about the lifecycle needs Kotlin.

     * `settings.json`. Without this, every existing user's settings silently reset the day the SDL UI
     * becomes the shipping one — their theme included, which is the one they would notice.
     *
     * It is written HERE rather than in C++ because SharedPreferences is a Java API backed by an XML
     * file whose format is Android's business, not ours: `getBoolean` with the same default the
     * Compose app used is a fact, and parsing that XML from C++ would be a guess maintained forever.
     *
     * ⚠️⚠️ **VERSIONED, NOT KEYED OFF "settings.json IS ABSENT" — and that distinction is the whole
     * design.** The obvious guard is *"no settings.json + prefs exist → import"*, and it gets exactly
     * ONE chance: the moment the SDL app runs once, settings.json exists forever after and no later
     * migration can ever fire. Phase D adds SKIN and OVERLAY selections (indices into lists that did not
     * exist at v1 — see the note in `settings_store.cpp`), so a second pass was always coming, and the
     * "absent file" guard would have made it unreachable before it was written. The version counter is
     * what keeps that honest: v2 folds the two new stable-string keys into the SAME fresh-install write
     * (the real upgrade path — a user who only ever ran Compose has no settings.json yet), and stamps v2
     * so it never re-runs. An existing settings.json still WINS (below): a population that already ran
     * the debug SDL activity has SDL-chosen values there, and re-importing older prefs over them would be
     * a regression dressed as a migration.
     *
     * ⚠️ **The defaults below are ANDROID's, not `SettingsValues`'s, and they disagree on purpose.**
     * `button_sound` and `button_vibro` default TRUE in the Compose app while the C++ struct defaults
     * them FALSE; `button_sound_volume` is 0x80 there and 255 here. What must survive a migration is
     * what the user actually EXPERIENCED, and for a row they never touched that is the value the
     * Compose app was using — so the pref's own default is the correct thing to read and write. Taking
     * the C++ defaults instead would silently switch off button sound for every user who had left it
     * alone, which is exactly the class of upgrade bug this whole function exists to prevent.
     *
     * ⚠️ **`app_theme` is passed through VERBATIM, and that is sound rather than lazy.**
     * `theme_io.h`'s `serialize_theme` states in its own comment that it emits kotlinx's bytes, and
     * all 18 colour defaults plus `name` and `visualizerType` were compared field by field against
     * `AppTheme.kt` — they are identical. Since both sides OMIT fields equal to their default, a
     * mismatch anywhere would have silently recoloured a theme, which is why it was checked rather
     * than assumed. Re-serialising it here would add a second format to keep in step for no gain.
     *
     * ⚠️ **Debug and release do NOT share SharedPreferences.** `applicationIdSuffix = ".debug"` gives
     * this build its own data directory, so what this reads today is whatever the *debug* Compose
     * activity wrote — not the songs-and-settings of the real install. That is a testing note, not a
     * defect: in Phase E the SDL activity replaces `MainActivity` inside the one real package and the
     * prefs it reads are the user's own. To exercise it, run "SPRITESTEP" (debug Compose), change
     * some settings, delete settings.json, then run "PT (SDL)".
