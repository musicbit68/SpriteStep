// ─── The licence payload that ships INSIDE the APK ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// SPRITESTEP is GPL-3.0-or-later and statically links a dozen third-party components, so their
// notices have to travel with the BINARY and not merely with the source tree that built it — GPL-3.0
// §4 and BSD-3-Clause both word the obligation around what the recipient of the ARTIFACT receives.
// The Windows zip, the Linux tarball and the PortMaster zip each stage this set into a `licenses/`
// folder beside the executable. The APK is the one artifact with no "beside the executable", so the
// same set goes into `assets/licenses/`.
//
// They are COPIED at build time rather than checked in under `src/main/assets/`, so
// `docs/licenses/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` stays the single source of truth and no second copy exists
// to drift from it. Assets — unlike `res/` — are untouched by `isShrinkResources`, so the release APK
// keeps every one.
//
// ⚠️ The wiring is `addGeneratedSourceDirectory`, NOT `sourceSets.assets.srcDir(...)` plus a
// hand-written `dependsOn`: it makes the asset-merge task consume this task's output directory by
// construction, so no ordering can put the merge first.
//
// ⚠️ Nothing READS these files — they are payload, and their whole job is to exist. So a missing one
// breaks no build and throws nothing at run time: it would ship silently, and a green build is no
// evidence at all. The only evidence is the finished APK, which the release build verifies by reading
// every one back out of it and comparing the bytes (a truncated copy unzips just as cleanly).
