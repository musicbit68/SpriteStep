Each library keeps its own license. SPRITESTEP as a whole is distributed under GPL-3.0-or-later (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)).

**Full notices for everything compiled into SPRITESTEP — the audio engine and the SDL shell alike,
across all four packages — are in [`docs/licenses/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](docs/licenses/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md),**
which is the single source of truth and travels inside every release artifact.

**Oboe and the two AndroidX rows are Gradle-resolved rather than compiled from `native/`**, so they
exist only in the APK. Apache-2.0 §4(a) requires that a copy of the License reach anyone who receives
the binary, and naming it here does not do that — **the full Apache-2.0 text is in the notices file**,
which is why the notices cover them too despite not being engine code.

This file ships beside the notices in every artifact rather than only in the repo —
`assets/licenses/CREDITS.md` in the APK, and `licenses/CREDITS.md` in the Windows zip, the Linux
tarball and the PortMaster zip.

> **Note on DaisySP:** it is not uniformly MIT. Of the eight files SPRITESTEP compiles, five are
> MIT (`svf`, `overdrive`, `decimator`, `limiter`, `crossfade`) and **three are LGPL-2.1** —
> `compressor` (GRAME / Centre National de Creation Musicale), `balance` (Barry Vercoe, john ffitch,
> Gabriel Maldonado) and `reverbsc` (Sean Costello, Istvan Varga, Paul Batchelor) — because those
> descend from Csound and Faust rather than from Electrosmith's own code. LGPL-2.1 §3 permits
> applying the ordinary GPL v2 "or any later version", so they are distributed here under
> GPL-3.0-or-later along with the rest of the app. Per-file detail in the notices file above.

## DSP algorithm references

- **SOLA time-stretch** — Roucos & Wilgus (1985), Verhelst & Roelands (1993). The "Akai-cyclic" mode matches the algorithm used in Akai S950 / S1000 samplers; the characteristic grit on jungle breaks is intentional.
- **Biquad filter design** — Robert Bristow-Johnson, *Audio EQ Cookbook* (1994, rev. 2016).
- **OTT 3-band compressor** — parameters matched to the Xfer Records vitOTT plugin. Downward: −27 dBFS / 8:1; upward: −35 dBFS / 4:1; ~8 dB neutral zone.
- **Spectral flux transient detection** — Brossier et al., "Fast labelling of notes in music signals," ICASSP 2004.
