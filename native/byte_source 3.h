// ─── pt_fopen and friends — the one place a path string becomes a file operation ─────────────────
//
// Every touch of a user file below the UI goes through here: samples, soundfonts, projects, `.pti`
// presets, the render's own read-back, the "is this file still there?" probe — and the render's
// publish step, which deletes a stale target and renames a temp over it.
//
// **Why an indirection at all, when every one of them could just call `fopen`.** A path is not
// always a path. A directory a user grants through a system file picker is addressed by a URI with
// a scheme, and no libc call can touch one; it is resolved by the host. Deciding *which kind of
// string this is* has to happen somewhere, and the one thing it must not be is a check at each of
// the call sites: correctness would then rest on every future caller remembering to write it. So it
// is derived from the data, once, below all of them.
//
// **On a host that installs no hooks** every function here takes its plain libc branch and this is
// a rename. A URI with no hook fails, which is the right answer on a desktop.
//
// ⚠️ **The hooks arrive as ONE struct, and are installed by one call.** A host does not get to
// resolve opens and leave deletes on libc: half-hooked is the state where a render writes its temp
// through the host and then asks libc to rename a string libc cannot even see, which fails as
// "the export did not appear" with nothing in the log about storage.
//
// ⚠️ **They live in `byte_source.cpp`, not as an inline variable in this header, and that is
// deliberate.** On Android the engine (`libspritestep.so`) reads them while the shell
// (`libspritestep-sdl.so`) installs them. An inline variable is one COMDAT symbol per binary,
// kept single only by ELF interposition — which a `-fvisibility=hidden` added for size, at any point
// in the future, would silently break: the shell would install into its copy and the engine would
// keep reading its own null one, and the failure is a file that will not open with nothing in the
// log to say why. One definition in one translation unit does not depend on a flag.

 * (Android: `ParcelFileDescriptor.detachFd()`, not `getFd()`).
 *
 * `mode` is the stdio mode string as given to `pt_fopen`. A write mode may CREATE, because the
 * strings that reach here are composable — the host can derive the parent and the name from the
 * path (`shell/saf-filesystem.h`). ⚠️ **Append is not required of a hook**: nothing below the UI
