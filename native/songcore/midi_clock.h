// ─── SYNC OUT — the 24 PPQN clock and the transport (MIDI plan phase C) ───────────────────────────
//
// What phase B put on the cable was NOTES. This is the other half of driving external gear: the
// TRANSPORT (start/stop/continue, and where in the song we are) and the TEMPO, as a stream of 24
// clock ticks per quarter note. A drum machine fed these plays at our tempo, starts when we start and
// stops when we stop, with no note ever sent to it.
//
// ⚠️ **PLATFORM-FREE AND CLOCK-FREE, like everything else in songcore.** This object owns no time
// source: frames arrive as arguments, exactly as `ExternalConsumer::pump` and `FrameEstimator::estimate`
// take theirs. That is what lets `tools/ptmidi` drive it with a synthetic clock and measure the
// arithmetic to the frame.
//
// ── ⭐ THE PLAN SAID "PHASE-LOCKED THROUGH TEMPO **AND GROOVE** CHANGES". THE GROOVE HALF IS NOT
//    IMPLEMENTABLE, AND THE REASON IS A FACT ABOUT THE SEQUENCER, NOT A SHORTCUT ────────────────────
//
// §10-C reads: *"24 PPQN clock (with TICS_PER_STEP = 12, quarter = 48 tics → one clock per 2 tics,
// phase-locked to the frame clock through tempo/groove changes)"*. Counting the clock in TICS is only
// meaningful if there is ONE tic grid to count on. There is not: **groove is per TRACK**, held in
// `TrackState.grooveId` / `TrackState.grooveStep` (scheduler.h), and eight tracks may be running eight
// different grooves at once, each stretching and shrinking its own steps. "The" groove does not exist,
// so a single global clock cannot follow it — and MIDI has exactly one clock stream.
//
// So the clock follows **TEMPO**, which IS global (`Project::tempo`, one value, live-editable, no
// per-step tempo FX exists anywhere in the tree — grep `setTempo`). A quarter note is
// `frames_per_step(tempo, sr) * 4` frames and gets 24 ticks, phase-locked to `playbackStartFrame_`.
// A grooved track swings against a steady clock, which is what a swung track does against a metronome
// and what every other tracker's sync out does. ⭐ **A mechanism in a ratified plan is a hypothesis**
// (the guardrails' own rule, and B3 hit the same one) — this is the third time that has cashed out.
//
// ── WHY THE TICK FRAME IS A RATIO AND NEVER AN ACCUMULATION ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// `tick_frame(k) = epoch + k * framesPerQuarter / PPQN`, in int64, from a fixed epoch — NOT
// `next += period`. The difference is not stylistic, and here is the measurement rather than the
// argument: at 128 BPM / 44.1 kHz a quarter is **20 668 frames** (four truncated `frames_per_step`s of
// 5167) and a tick is 861.17 of them. An integer `period` of 861 loses a sixth of a frame per tick —
// which ptmidi's control prints as **600 frames, 13.6 ms, over 70 seconds of playing**, or ~11.6 ms a
// minute: a drum machine visibly walking away from us over one song. The ratio form has no accumulator
// to drift and is exact for every k: tick 24k lands on quarter k to the frame, forever.
//
// Overflow is not a concern and here is the number: an hour of playing is ~184 000 ticks against a
// ~20 000-frame quarter, so the product peaks near 3.7e9 — nine orders below int64's roof.
//
// ── THE EPOCH, AND WHAT A TEMPO CHANGE DOES TO IT ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The epoch is the transport's start frame, so tick 0 is the downbeat and tick 6k is step k — the same
// grid the scheduler puts notes on, by construction rather than by luck. When the user turns TEMPO
// while playing, `rebase` moves the epoch forward to the NEXT tick's frame under the OLD tempo and
// restarts the index at 0 under the new one. So the tick about to be emitted keeps its slot and every
// one after it follows the new tempo: continuous, never backwards, no tick lost or doubled.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE BURST CAP, which exists for a case the desktop never sees ──────────────────────────────
//
// `pump` emits every tick due at or before `now`. If the audio device stalls and resumes — an Android
// suspend, a CFW power menu — `now` jumps by the whole stall at once and the honest reading of "every
// tick due" is a burst of hundreds of clock bytes, which a device receives as a tempo spike. Past
// `MAX_BURST_TICKS` the backlog is SKIPPED rather than sent: the index advances (so the grid stays
// phase-locked to the song) and one tick goes out. `dropped_ticks()` counts them, because a component
// that silently swallows work cannot be told from one that had nothing to do.
//
// (`FrameEstimator`'s 30 ms lead cap bounds how far the WALL can run ahead of the audio; it does not
// bound how far the AUDIO can jump when it resumes. Two different stalls, two different guards.)
