// ─── The factory scale bank ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The named shapes A+LEFT/RIGHT cycles on the SCALE screen's top row, and the same list the app writes
// to `<card>/Scales/` as `.pts` files the first time it finds that folder without any.
//
// ⚠️ COMPILED IN, NOT LOADED. The cycle has to work on a fresh card, on a card someone has emptied, and
// on the first launch before anything has been written — so the list a user picks from can never be a
// list that has to be read off storage first. The files are the SHAREABLE copy of it, not its source.
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS A DISPLAY ORDER, NOT AN IDENTITY. Unlike `EFFECT_TYPES`, nothing stores an index into it:
// a scale slot stores its twelve bits, and a `.pts` stores them too. So rows may be reordered or
// inserted freely — which is why it is sorted for a musician (the modes together, the pentatonics
// together) rather than kept in the order of the sheet it was transcribed from.
//
// ⚠️ A MASK IS COUNTED FROM THE KEY, NOT FROM C. Bit k set = the note k semitones above the key is in
// the scale, so one entry describes a shape the KEY then positions — the same relationship `Scale`
// itself has, and the reason bit 0 is set in every row here.
//
// ⭐ CHROMATIC IS INDEX 0 AND THAT IS NOT DECORATION: a default-constructed slot has all twelve degrees
// enabled, so slot 00 of a project that has never been touched already IS this entry. "Reset this slot"
// and "load Chromatic" are therefore the same gesture, and nothing had to be added to make it so.
