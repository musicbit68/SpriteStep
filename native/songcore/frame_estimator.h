// ─── Where is the audio device RIGHT NOW? (MIDI plan phase B3) ────────────────────────────────────
//
// `AudioEngine::getCurrentFrame()` is a STAIRCASE. It is written once per audio block, at the end of
// `processAudioBlock` — 512 frames on the SDL backend, ~11.6 ms at 44.1 kHz — so reading it a thousand
// times a second gives a thousand readings with only ~86 distinct values. That is the whole reason a
// sender thread alone does not fix B3's problem: swapping a 60 Hz caller (16.7 ms of quantisation) for
// a 1 kHz one buys 16.7 → 11.6 ms, which is not the order of improvement phase C's clock needs.
//
// This turns the staircase back into a line: hold the last OBSERVED step as an anchor, and add the
// wall time elapsed since. `pump(now)` then gets a frame position with sub-millisecond resolution
// while still being anchored to the device rather than to the wall.
//
// ⚠️ **SONGCORE STILL OWNS NO CLOCK, and that is why this file has no `#include <chrono>`.** Wall
// microseconds arrive as an ARGUMENT, exactly as `ExternalConsumer::pump` takes its `now` — which is
// what makes both of them testable with a synthetic clock in `tools/ptmidi` and keeps the one real
// clock in the shell, where the platform lives.
//
// ── THE THREE RULES, each of which exists because leaving it out is a real failure ────────────────
//
//   1. **A LEAD CAP — audio is the clock, not the wall.** Without one, an audio device that stalls or
//      suspends (Android backgrounding, a CFW's power menu, an xrun storm) leaves the wall clock
//      running and the frame counter frozen, so MIDI would keep playing in real time against silent
//      audio and stay permanently ahead of it afterwards. Capped, MIDI freezes with the audio and
//      resumes in step. The cost is stated rather than hidden: during a stall, queued note-offs wait,
//      and `SongcoreHost::stop()`'s panic remains the backstop that ends them.
//   2. **MONOTONIC BETWEEN ANCHORS.** `pump` releases everything due at or before `now` and a frame
//      that went backwards would not un-send them — but a LEN gate compares against the same clock,
//      and a clock that stutters backwards under jitter can close a gate twice.
//   3. **A NEW ANCHOR RESETS THE FLOOR, INCLUDING BACKWARDS.** `AudioEngine::resetFrameCounter()`
//      puts the counter back to 0 at the start of every offline render. Rule 2 applied blindly across
//      that would pin the estimate at the pre-render value for the life of the process — the estimator
//      would be permanently past the end of time, and every message queued afterwards would release
//      instantly. (The cable is detached for a render, so this is not a live defect today. It is one
//      the moment anything else resets that counter, and the reset is not this file's to see.)
