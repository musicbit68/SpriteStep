// ─── The sample editor, below the seam (Phase 3 S6b) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// **Almost none of the sample editor is here, and that is the headline.** Every one of its twelve
// operations — crop, copy, cut, dupl, paste, del, normalise, fade in, fade out, silence, reverse, undo
// — plus the FX chain, the pitch shift, the time stretch and the transient detector, already live in
// `native/sample-editor.cpp` and `native/transient-detector.cpp`, in C++, and always did: Android's JNI
// layer is a thin forward and nothing more. `SongcoreHost` exposes them as verbs (host.h) and the whole
// of that is a one-line call each.
//
// What lands in THIS file is only what the engine cannot do on its own, because it needs something the
// engine does not have — the ROUTING (a sample's rate ratio, which songcore owns because songcore is
// what opened the file) or the PROJECT (the instrument being auditioned). There are four such things:
//
//   • **the RATE mode's ratio cache** — Kotlin's `originalSampleRateRatios`, a map that exists so LOFI
//     → HIGH can restore the ratio the file was loaded with rather than compounding factors;
//   • **the SOURCE preview** — a stereo sample auditioned as LEFT / RIGHT / MONO plays out of a scratch
//     slot, not its own, so the pitch it plays at must be borrowed from the instrument's ratio;
//   • **the DRY audition** — the raw waveform with the instrument's EQ, sends and modulation switched
//     off, which is the entire reason to have an audition inside an editor;
//   • **SAVE and CHOP** — pulling the edited PCM back out and writing it, with its slice boundaries, as
//     a WAV (`wav_writer.h`).

 * filter" while `updateInstrumentPlaybackParams` pushes one.)
