// ─── AUS / AUF — what can be automated, and how a pair is found ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Automating a parameter means moving it continuously across a span of steps instead of writing it
// once per step. The author puts the parameter at its starting value, puts AUS beside it to say
// "ramp from here, with this curve", and AUF on a later step to say "arrive at this value".
//
//     step 00   VOL 00  AUS 80        ← start at 0, linear
//     step 08   AUF FF                ← arrive at 255 eight steps later
//
// This header is the PURE half: the registry of parameters a ramp can move, the curve, and the
// pairing rule. It emits nothing and knows nothing about frames, ticks, grooves or the transport —
// `find_ramps` answers "which spans does this phrase declare", in STEP indices, and the scheduler
// turns a span into events.
//
// ⚠️ **THAT SPLIT IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT TIDINESS.** Pairing in step space needs no frame table, so the
// groove trap the design doc warned about — a pre-scan that walks the phrase to find span frames and
// double-advances `TrackState::grooveStep` on the way — cannot exist here. The emitter already holds
// each step's real duration as it walks, so a groove-warped span costs it nothing, and a HOP out of
// the phrase truncates the ramp for free by ending the walk.

// ─── The registry — which parameters a ramp can move ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A ramp is nothing but the parameter's own CC, emitted more often. So the entry price is exactly
// "this parameter has an absolute, sample-accurate set-to-X-at-frame-F path" — a CC id inside the
// existing EV_CC, an arm in `EngineConsumer::consume`, and a queued apply on the audio thread. Those
// three are what live control costs whether or not anything ramps it; automation adds no fourth.
//
// ⚠️ **THE SET IS THIS TABLE, NOT A PROPERTY OF THE FEATURE.** It is short today because only six
// effects have paid that price, not because a ramp is limited to six things. Adding a seventh is:
// give it a CC id, an arm, an apply, and a row here.
//
// ⚠️ There is deliberately no range column and no density column. Every entry's ceiling is already
// `effect_value_max(fxCode)` (asserted below) and the emission grid is one constant for all of them —
// a column holding the same value in every row is a claim that it varies, and the day it stops being
// true the table and the truth part company silently.
// ⚠️ **WHAT THE TWO ENDPOINTS MEAN — the one thing that is not the same for every row.**
//
//  • `BYTE` — the endpoints are VALUES, and the ramp interpolates the authored byte itself. This is
//    the sentence the paragraph above is written in: the ramp is the parameter's own CC, emitted
//    more often.
//  • `EQ_PRESET` — the endpoints are INDICES into `Project::eqPresets`, and interpolating them would
//    walk presets 05, 06, 07 … which is a slideshow, not a fade. What moves is the twelve numbers the
//    two referenced presets HOLD, and the tick carries them as band values (`ExtEqMorphPayload`).
//
// A third kind is a third answer to "what does the AUF's byte mean?", and nothing else — every rule
// below (looking left, last-AUS-wins, the chain boundary, the curve) is indifferent to it.

 *
 *  • **AUS looks LEFT on its own step** for the nearest automatable effect, skipping ones that are
 *    not (`VOL 20  PSL 40  AUS 00` ramps the VOL). That effect's type is the parameter and its value
 *    is the start byte, so the number the ramp begins at is a number visible in the grid, typed as an
 *    ordinary effect — and it still emits its own per-step event, so the authored start and the
 *    ramp's first sample agree by construction rather than by arithmetic.
 *  • **An AUS with nothing automatable to its left is INERT** — it does not open, and it does not
 *    close or replace a ramp already open. A curve on its own names no parameter, and guessing one
 *    would move something the author never pointed at.
 *  • **AUF must be on a LATER step**, and the FIRST one closes. An AUF sharing a step with its AUS is
 *    inert and leaves the ramp open: slot order inside a step is not a time order, and the span it
 *    would describe has no duration to interpolate across.
 *  • **An EQ_PRESET endpoint that is not a slot is INERT, at either end.** The AUF cell accepts
 *    00-FF and a preset index is 00-7F, so `AUF C0` over an EQM names nothing; it does not close the
 *    ramp, and — like every other unused AUS/AUF cell — it draws DIM, so the author sees it in the
 *    grid the moment they type it. ⚠️ **The open AUS stays open**, so a later, legal AUF still closes
 *    the span. The same rule at the start end leaves the AUS itself inert rather than letting it walk
 *    further left onto a parameter the author was not pointing at.
 *  • **The last AUS wins**, matching the last-wins convention the FX slots already follow: a second
 *    AUS before any AUF replaces the open ramp rather than nesting.
 *  • **An unclosed AUS at the end of the phrase produces nothing.** Pairing is per-phrase — the AUF
 *    of a future phrase has not been scheduled yet, and inventing an end would mean guessing it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Reads the AUTHORED step, before CHA/RND/RNL touch anything. A ramp therefore never joins the
 * non-reproducible set (`tools/ptnondet`): randomising the curve or the destination would make the
 * same project render differently twice, and a fade is not a thing anyone wants dice on. RND on an
 * AUS, AUF or start-value slot is ignored for pairing purposes.
 */
/**
 * Does this phrase carry an AUS or an AUF cell at all?

//
// A phrase is 16 steps, which at any useful tempo is a bar or less — so a fade written the way
// `find_ramps` pairs it can never be longer than a bar, and "fade this in over the four bars of the
// intro" is not expressible at all. The AUF is allowed to sit in a LATER PHRASE OF THE SAME CHAIN,
// which is what the walk below works out.
//
// ⚠️ **THE CHAIN IS THE BOUNDARY, AND IT IS A REAL ONE.** Pairing stops at the end of the chain: a
// chain is the unit a track repeats and re-enters, and a span that ran past it would have to survive
// the song moving to a different chain, a chain played from two song rows at once, and CHAIN mode's
// wrap back to row 0. Sixteen rows of sixteen steps is 256 steps of ramp, which is the length of the
// thing anyone has asked for.
//
// ⭐⭐ **IT IS RE-DERIVED ON EVERY CALL, NOT CARRIED IN `TrackState`.** The obvious implementation
// leaves the open AUS in the track's state and lets successive `schedulePhrase` calls advance it, and
// it is wrong in three ways at once, all of them invisible until they are not: `notify_data_changed`
// rolls the lookahead back to an earlier chain row WITHOUT rewinding `TrackState` (see the checkpoint
// ring), so a live edit would jump the fade forward by a phrase; a chain re-entered from a later song
// row would inherit the previous one's open ramp; and the same phrase scheduled twice would advance it
// twice. Deriving the whole picture from (chain, chainRow) each time makes every one of those
// questions unaskable — the same reason the emitter measures `t` in steps rather than accumulating
// frames.

/**
 * Every ramp playing over the phrase at `chainRow`, whether it opened there or in an earlier row.
 *
 * Spans are returned as this phrase sees them: `ausStep` is −1 when the AUS is behind us, `aufStep`
 * is −1 when the AUF is ahead, and `stepsBefore` says how far along the ramp already was when this
 * phrase began. `startRow` is the HOP entry point and applies only to ramps opening in THIS phrase —
 * a phrase entered below its own AUS runs no ramp, exactly as `find_ramps` has it, while one entered
 * below a step a ramp from an earlier row is merely passing through is unaffected.
 *
 * ⚠️ Empty chain rows contribute NO steps, matching the traversal: the scheduler skips them without
 * scheduling anything, so counting them would drift the fade against the notes.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE WALK IS THE AUTHORED ONE, AND A HOP CAN MAKE THE REAL ONE SHORTER.** A HOP inside the span
 * ends its phrase early, so fewer steps play than this counted and the fade is a little further along
 * than the step count says when the next phrase picks it up. It still starts at the start byte and
 * still arrives at the destination on the AUF's own step — the error is in the middle and bounded by
 * the steps the HOP skipped. Reading the real traversal instead is not available: the HOP itself can
 * be CHA-gated, so how far the phrase gets is not knowable until it has been walked, which is the
 * same reason nothing is ever emitted ahead of the walk.

// ─── Which cells of ONE phrase a ramp uses — the question the editor asks ────────────────────────
//
// The editor draws a phrase, and a phrase has no single playing context: the same sixteen steps may
// sit at several rows of a chain, in several chains, in neither. A ramp, meanwhile, is a property of
// a CHAIN WALK. So the cell question — *is this AUS doing anything?* — is answered over EVERY context
// the project plays the phrase in, and the cell is live if any one of them uses it.
//
// ⚠️ **THE UNION IS THE HONEST ANSWER, AND ASKING ONE CONTEXT IS NOT.** Dimming means "you wrote
// something inert"; a cell live in one of its contexts is not inert, and saying so would send the
// author hunting a bug in a fade that plays. The imprecision runs the other way instead — a cell live
// in one chain draws live everywhere, which is the most an editor with one cell and many contexts can
// say without lying.
