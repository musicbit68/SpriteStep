// ─── The sequencer spine ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A 1:1 port of core/logic/PlaybackController.kt (+ its TrackState) — the "doomed" Kotlin
// sequencing zone rewritten as C++ songcore (linux-port-plan §4.3, order-of-work zone C). It walks
// the project by transport position exactly as the Kotlin scheduler does — grooves, HOP, RPT/ARP
// grids, LAT, KIL, pitch mods, per-note/mixer FX — and emits the identical event stream through the
// MidiRouter seam (router.h), which the trace writer serializes for the byte-for-byte conformance
// check against /tools/testdata/traces (event-schema §6).
//
// PlaybackController.kt is the executable spec; every method, branch, and float expression here
// mirrors it, including the historically-crossed velGain/volGain wiring and the intentional groove
// rounding drift. The floats are computed as binary32 with the SAME operation order as Kotlin's `Xf`
// literals, so the raw-bits trace fields reproduce (S3 already proved the shared arithmetic bitwise;
// tools/ptplay proves the whole spine).
//
// S4 shipped the event-emitting spine alone. S5 adds the three pieces a LIVE app needs that carry no
// bus event and therefore no golden (event-schema §5 / SC-4) — they are pure SIDE-RECORDS kept
// alongside the walk, and the proof that they stay side-records is that tools/ptplay must remain
// byte-green on all 32 traces with them in:
//   * getPlaybackPosition() + its chainRowStartFrames / songPositionStartFrames maps — the UI cursor;
//   * the scheduling-checkpoint ring + notify_data_changed() rollback — the live-edit reaction
//     (SC-2: only the POSITION rolls back, never TrackState — the state smear is today's behavior);
//   * eqm_active() — setMasterEqSlot is not a bus event, so the master-EQ restore on stop() is the
//     host's job; the flag tells it whether an EQM ran (PlaybackController.eqmActive).
//   * mixer_vol_active() — the same shape for VTR/VMV, which REPLACE the mixer faders and hold. The
//     CCs themselves ARE bus events and are goldened; what is not an event is putting the faders back.
// Random FX (CHA/RND/RNL/ARP-RANDOM) are excluded from the goldens (SC-1) — a stream seeded from the
// wall clock has no byte-comparable golden, on either engine. They are therefore the one part of the
// spine measured statistically instead: rng.h holds the generator and the reasoning, and
// tools/ptrandom checks its distributions against the real Kotlin sequencer's (S7).

//

// own is in no chain and in no song; a track whose song column has run out has stopped. Filling
// those with zeros is what put a frozen playhead on row 0 of CHAIN and SONG while a PHRASE played,
// and any consumer that draws a marker on a zero will do it again.
//
// ⚠️ **THE IDS ARE PART OF THE POSITION.** A chain row means nothing without the chain it is a row
// of: the CHAIN screen shows one chain and two tracks may be inside it at two different rows while
// a third is inside a chain the screen is not showing. Same for a phrase step.

// byte-compared goldens — therefore needs no arm for a mode it has no answer for, and a project that
// never enters LIVE produces the identical schedule.
//
// ⚠️ `targetRow < 0 && !stop` is the empty slot. A stop queue carries no row, which is why "nothing
// queued" cannot be expressed by the row alone.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ **A SLOT IS SCHEDULED LONG BEFORE IT IS HEARD, AND THE SCREEN ANSWERS TO THE SECOND.** The
// lookahead runs two phrases ahead, so a queue consumed by the walk has up to two phrases still to
// play before anything changes — and clearing the slot on consumption made the blinking marker go
// out a bar or two early, while the player was still waiting for the launch they could see coming.

    // It survived this long because it is invisible on real music, which is many phrases long, so the
    // key being rewritten is always far in the future. The SDL shell surfaced it immediately by playing
    // a one-row golden (g7-audio: 1 song row over a 2-row chain — exactly the lookahead depth, so the

     * ⚠️ It is the SCHEDULER's scale, read off `TrackState` on the scheduler's own clock — correct
     * precisely because this runs at schedule time, two phrases ahead of what is heard, and the note
     * being built here is one of those future notes. Nothing below the seam may re-ask this
     * question: at the far end the answer would be the scale of a bar nobody has reached.
     *
     * Four cases are deliberately left alone:
     *  · a CHROMATIC scale — the identity that makes every song written before this feature cost
     *    nothing, checked first rather than falling out of the search;
     *  · an instrument with TRANSP. off (model.h — M8's rule, wider than scales);
     *  · ⚠️ a note that is SELECTING A SLICE, where the number is not a pitch at all. M8 shipped
     *    exactly this defect and fixed it ("Scale issues with Sampler slice mode"): quantizing a
     *    sliced kit plays a different drum, not a different note;
     *  · a pitch outside 0..127 at either end of the arithmetic. No scale degree lives out there,
     *    an authored B-9 (131) must stay 131 rather than be dragged into range, and a correction
     *    that cannot be expressed on the base note is not applied at all rather than clamped into
     *    a pitch nobody asked for.
