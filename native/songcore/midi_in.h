// ─── MIDI IN — bytes from a cable become bus events (MIDI plan phase E, §5) ──────────────────────
//
// The mirror image of midi_out.h, and deliberately shaped like it: `IMidiIn` is the platform seam,
// everything above it is platform-free, and the one routing question ("whose note is this?") is
// answered by ONE rule that every consumer asks rather than by each consumer's private test.
//
// Three objects, and the split is the point — each is the answer to a different kind of question:
//
//   • `MidiInQueue`  — WHO OWNS THE THREAD. A backend receives bytes on a thread it does not choose
//     (winmm calls back on its own; ALSA blocks in `read`; Android delivers on a binder thread), so
//     the bytes are parked in one lock-guarded ring and the app drains them where it likes. Written
//     ONCE, above the seam, for the reason midi-out-base.h states: three backends each carrying their
//     own ring is three rings that diverge in one of the copies.
//   • `MidiParser`   — THE PROTOCOL, and nothing else. Running status, real-time bytes arriving in the
//     middle of another message, SysEx, orphan data bytes. It reports the wire FAITHFULLY and makes no
//     policy decisions at all — including the note-on-velocity-0 convention, which is a `MidiInMessage`
//     predicate below rather than a rewrite here, so that every future reader of a message gets the
//     same answer without remembering to.
//   • `MidiInputRouter` — THE POLICY. Which track does channel 5 drive, which instrument is that
//     track's, and what does a bus record for it look like. This is where `Project::midiInputChannels`
//     — round-tripped since B1 and, until now, read by NOTHING — finally has a consumer.
//
// ⚠️ **NOTHING HERE TOUCHES A CLOCK OR A PORT.** `route` takes the frame as an argument, exactly as
// `ExternalConsumer::pump` and `FrameEstimator::estimate` take theirs, and it returns records into a
// caller's array rather than calling anything. That is what makes the whole of phase E's protocol half
// testable in a host tool with no device, no cable and no wall clock (tools/ptmidiin).
//
// ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   • **SYNC IN** (slaving the transport to an external clock) is §9-deferred. The parser therefore
//     REPORTS real-time bytes (0xF8-0xFF) as one-byte messages — the protocol is the protocol — and the
//     router drops them and COUNTS the drop. A parser that swallowed them would have to be reopened to
//     add sync; a router that dropped them silently could not be told from one that never ran.
//   • **the §4.1 note-off rule** (ADSR/TRIG release, one-shot ignore, looping soft-kill) — the RULE
//     itself, which is an engine decision and lives in `SamplerVoice::keyRelease`. What this file does
//     since E4 is name it: a key release emits `NOTE_OFF_KEY`, which is a different thing from the
//     `NOTE_OFF_RELEASE` a KIL emits, and the engine consumer translates the two separately.
//   • **recording into phrases** and the MIDI-learn map — §9, both.

 *
 *   • **running status** — a status byte holds until the next one, so `90 3C 40 3E 40 40 40` is three
 *     note-ons. Without it a keyboard's fast passages arrive as orphan data bytes.
 *   • **real-time bytes interleaved MID-MESSAGE.** 0xF8-0xFF may legally appear between the status byte

 *     not the half-assembled message. A parser that resets on any status byte ≥ 0x80 eats the note it
 *     was in the middle of — and only while a clock is running, which is exactly when nobody is
 *     watching for it.
 *   • **System Common cancels running status** (MIDI 1.0 spec). 0xF1-0xF6 are one-shot; a data byte
 *     after one is an orphan, not a continuation of the channel message before it.
 *   • **SysEx is skipped** to its 0xF7, and cancels running status on the way in.
 *   • **an orphan data byte is dropped and counted.** It means the stream was joined mid-message (a
 *     cable plugged in while a controller was mid-sweep, or a ring overflow) and resync is the correct
 *     behaviour, but a stream that is *all* orphans is a bug and the count is the only thing that says

/**
 * Told about every message the host drained, with the bus records it produced.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE APP's THREAD, NOT THE BACKEND's** — this is called from `SongcoreHost::poll()`, which is the
 * frame loop, and everything a backend's own thread does ends at `MidiInQueue::on_bytes`. That is the
 * whole reason the queue exists, and it is why an implementation of this may do anything it likes
 * (print, allocate, call the engine) where an `IMidiInSink` may not.
 *
 * `count` may be 0: a message that routed nowhere is still a message that ARRIVED, and telling the two
 * apart is the difference between "the cable is dead" and "no track is listening on that channel" —
 * two problems with completely different fixes, which is the same argument as the router's four
 * counters. E2's implementation is the shell's console; E4's is the injection into the engine.
