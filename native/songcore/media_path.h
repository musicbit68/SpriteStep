// ─── Making a stored path mean something on THIS device ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A path written into a project — or into config.json — is a place named by a human, or by an earlier
// install, that has to resolve here. The three ways it can be wrong are all handled below: it may be
// RELATIVE to the project rather than to us, it may be ABSOLUTE under an app root this device does not
// have, and its CASE may not match a case-sensitive disk.
//
// ⚠️ **Two callers, one rule.** `resolve_media_path` is a project's sample/SF2 paths; `pt::ui::
// resolve_browse_dir` (ui/folder_config.h) is config.json's browse folders. Both re-root through
// `app_root_relative_tail`, and they must keep doing it through the SAME function: the day the two
// disagree is the day a project finds its samples in a folder the browser will not open.
//
// Nothing here links a library beyond <filesystem>, and nothing here knows what a Project is — which is
// why it is its own header rather than part of engine_setup.h, whose job is pushing a project into an
// engine.

#include <filesystem>   // resolve_case_insensitive — Android storage is case-insensitive, the SD card is not

// no-extra-link-library rule the path helpers below keep. Used only to decide whether an absolute path
// needs relocating; a false negative (a file that exists but cannot be opened) at worst re-roots to the
// same-or-a-worse guess, and the load fails either way, so it costs nothing it did not already cost.
//
// ⚠️ **The probe goes through pt_fopen, and this is the site where getting that wrong is SILENT.**
// Every other opener reports a failure. This one only answers a question, and a "no" here sends
// resolve_media_path off to re-root a path that was already correct: the project loads, the
// instrument is empty, and nothing anywhere says so.

// stripped. Empty when the path is under no recognisable app sub-tree (a sample the user kept elsewhere).
//
// ⭐ **A URI is deliberately NOT excluded, and anchor 2 is why.** Android's paths are `pt://<root-id>/…`
// where the id is derived from the granted tree URI — so re-granting the same folder, or moving the home
// root, leaves a project full of absolute paths that name a tree this device no longer has. Those still
// carry "/Samples/", so they re-root onto the current home exactly as a phone-authored plain path does.
// The anchor only ever runs on a path that has already failed to open (see resolve_media_path).
//
// ⚠️ Anchor 2's list is the MEDIA sub-trees, not all seven app folders, because its other caller is a
// sample path. A browse folder under a foreign root NOT called SPRITESTEP — ".../data/Themes" — is
// therefore not re-rooted, and falls back to the category default rather than to a wrong guess.

// Resolve a path whose stored CASE may not match the disk. A project authored on Android references
// "Samples/Breaks/x.wav", but Android storage is case-INsensitive (FAT/sdcardfs) while a Linux SD card is

// component at a time from the longest existing prefix; where an exact child is missing, take the entry
// whose name matches case-insensitively. Returns the ORIGINAL path when no such chain exists, so a
// genuinely-absent file (a sample the user never copied) still fails naming what the project asked for.
//
// ⭐ It returns IMMEDIATELY when the exact path exists — which is every host-tool/golden case (their paths

// ⚠️ THE ONE EXCEPTION — a project MOVED between installs. Its paths were written absolute under the
// AUTHORING install's root (an Android phone's ".../Documents/SPRITESTEP/", another handheld's own
// $SPRITESTEP_HOME); copied onto THIS device they point nowhere. `app_root` — the folder THIS install

// tree on purpose (app_root_relative_tail returns "" otherwise) — a sample parked OUTSIDE SPRITESTEP/
// is genuinely unfindable and is left as-authored so the failure names the real path. Resolution only:
// the Project's stored string is NOT rewritten, so a re-save stays portable back to the phone.
