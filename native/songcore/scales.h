// ─── Scale quantization ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The pure half of roadmap 1.A: given a scale, a key and a MIDI note, which notes exist. No screen,
// no engine, no project — every consumer (the note cursor today, the transposes and ARP/PIT later)
// asks the same three functions so that "what is in this scale" has exactly one answer.
//
// ⚠️ THE IDENTITY CASE IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT AN OPTIMISATION. A chromatic scale — the default, and
// what every existing song has — must leave every note exactly where it is, or the feature rewrites
// music nobody asked it to touch. It is checked once, at the top of each entry point, rather than
// falling out of the search: a search that happens to be the identity today is a search that stops
// being the identity the first time someone changes a tie-break.
//
// ⚠️ A note is quantized in PITCH CLASS, so the octave a snap lands in is whatever the semitone
// arithmetic gives. Snapping C#-4 down to C-4 stays in octave 4; snapping B#-style edge cases across
// an octave boundary is the correct answer, not a wrap bug.

 * today and gains a new one only where the author asked for it.
 *
 * ⚠️ It walks semitone by semitone and counts the ones that land, rather than indexing a list of
 * degrees. Indexing needs the note to already BE in the scale; a note typed before the scale changed
 * is not, and the first press must move it somewhere sensible rather than nowhere. Walking answers
 * both cases with one rule.

 * asks, so that typing under an `SCA` offers that command's notes.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ **IT READS THE SONG, NEVER `TrackState`, AND THAT DISTINCTION IS THE WHOLE SAFETY ARGUMENT.**
 * A track's live scale is scheduler state, and the scheduler runs TWO PHRASES AHEAD of what is being
 * heard — wiring the cursor to it would quantize a typed note to the scale of a bar the player has
 * not reached yet, the shape of every LIVE-mode defect this project has had. What this walks instead
 * is the authored cells of the phrase that is on screen: a value the transport cannot move, that
 * reads the same whether anything is playing, and that a screenshot tool can reproduce.
 *
 * ⚠️ The two commands are resolved exactly as `Sequencer` resolves them, or the cursor and the sound
 * would disagree about a step carrying both: within one row the last of each wins across the three
 * slots, then `SCG` is applied and `SCA` second — the narrower command over the broader one.
 *
 * ⚠️ A command on the cursor's OWN row counts, because the scheduler applies both above the note on
 * their step. Typing a note on the same row as an `SCA` gets that command's scale, which is what the
 * screen shows.
 *
 * ⏸️ It sees this phrase and nothing else. An `SCA` in an EARLIER phrase of the same chain, and an
 * `SCG` typed on another track, both reach this row at playback and are invisible here — the cursor
 * then offers slot 00 while the sound follows the command. Widening the walk to the chain is the
 * obvious next step and needs the chain the phrase is being viewed THROUGH, which a phrase reached
 * from the pool does not have.
