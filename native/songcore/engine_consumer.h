// ─── The engine consumer — bus events become audio ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The C++ port of Kotlin's AudioEngine.scheduleNote() and its param-event siblings: everything BELOW
// the event-schema seam. THIS is the class that makes the app portable — on Android it replaces the
// Kotlin consumer, and the Linux/SDL shell inherits it unchanged. After it, there is no second
// implementation of "what a note means", which is the whole point of the songcore migration.
//
// It is deliberately thin. All the *derivation* — frequency, base frequency, the slice window, the SF
// slot/velocity/root transpose, tick→frame conversions, the modulation pushes — lives in voice_derive.h
// as pure functions, because the conformance trace stops at the router ABOVE this file and cannot
// prove any of it. Pure functions can be goldened against the real Kotlin code (S5ConsumerGoldenTest →
// tools/ptvoice); engine calls cannot. What is left here is the plumbing: look up, derive, call.
//
// The end-to-end check on top of that golden: an offline render is deterministic, so the same project
// rendered with ENGINE=KT and ENGINE=C++ must produce BYTE-IDENTICAL WAVs.
