// AUS/AUF's curve, the byte it produces at a position, and the one rule an EQ-preset morph adds on

// walk — and includes this.
//
// ⚠️ **IT IS SPLIT OUT BECAUSE IT HAS TWO CALLERS ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE SONGCORE SEAM.** The
// phrase path reaches it through `automation.h`; the TABLE path reaches it from inside `AudioEngine`,
// which sits below the seam and must not see `model.h`. A second implementation over there would be a
// second thing to keep bit-identical, and a table morph that felt different from a phrase morph over
// the same two presets is exactly the inconsistency the feature exists to remove.
//
// So: `<cstdint>` and nothing else, ever.

/**
 * One band of an EQ-preset morph at position `t`.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE START PRESET'S BAND TYPE SURVIVES THE WHOLE SPAN, ARRIVAL INCLUDED.** A type is not an
 * interpolable quantity — there is no continuous path from BELL to HISHELF, and LOWCUT/HICUT run
 * through the SVF and have no gain at all — so one of the two ends has to win, for every tick. The
 * start wins, and the morph never snaps:
 *
 *   • Types that AGREE (the normal case, and the one to write) make the arrival exactly the
 *     destination preset, by construction rather than by rounding.
 *   • Types that DIFFER still sweep that band's frequency and gain under the start's type, and the
 *     ramp rests on a setting no preset holds. To land on the real destination, write it — `EQM 12`
 *     on the step after the AUF is one cell, visible in the grid, and then the discontinuity is the
 *     author's rather than the ramp's.
 *
 * ⭐ A band OFF in the start preset stays off for the whole ramp, whatever the destination says — so
 * `chain.eq.active` (derived from "some type ≠ 0") cannot change mid-sweep and no band can pop in or
 * out. Fade a band out by ramping its GAIN to 0 dB (0x78) instead.
