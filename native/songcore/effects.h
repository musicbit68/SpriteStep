// ─── Effect resolution ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1:1 port of core/logic/EffectProcessor.kt: the FX_* effect codes, the ResolvedStepParams bundle,
// and resolveStepParams() — the pure function that folds a PhraseStep's three FX slots into the
// parameter bundle the scheduler consumes. Stateless; last-wins across the three slots (resolved
// 1 → 3), matching the Kotlin `when` overwrite order.
//
// The Kotlin TRACE logging is intentionally dropped — it is debug-only and never touches the resolved
// output. Effects with no resolved field (ARP / CHA / RND / RNL / TIC) are no-ops here, exactly as
// their `when` arms are: CHA/RND/RNL gate or rewrite the step BEFORE resolution (in the scheduler),
// ARP/TIC are applied from track state / the table engine.
//
// EffectProcessor.kt is the executable spec. tools/ptresolve proves this against a JVM golden.

// ─── MIDI phase D — the commands that speak the CC map (plan §8.3) ────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠️ **THESE ARE ROUTER EVENTS, NOT "EXTERNAL-ONLY EFFECTS".** They resolve to the same three bus
// records every other consumer already reads (EV_PROGRAM / EV_PITCH_BEND / EV_CC), so `CCA` on a
// SAMPLER instrument moves the mapped engine param and `CCA` on an EXTERNAL one puts a controller on
// the wire — one command vocabulary across module types, which is the whole payoff of the seam.
//
// ⚠️ A CC slot is named by its LETTER, never by a controller number: the number lives in the
// instrument (`Instrument::midiCC[slot].cc`), so the same phrase follows an instrument that has been
// re-patched. The letter→number resolution happens in the CONSUMER (event.h `CC_SLOT_A`), for the
// reason `TrackInstruments` exists at all — the step's instrument COLUMN is 0x00 on an FX-only step
// and is not the instrument that is sounding.

// ─── The mixer faders, as effects ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠️ **VTR REPLACES THE TRACK'S FADER, IT DOES NOT SCALE IT** — the same relationship Vxx has with the
// instrument volume, and the reason is that one byte cannot carry both. The MIXER screen keeps drawing
// the AUTHORED value throughout: the number you are editing must be the number you typed, so the fader
// on screen is where the song STARTS and VTR is where the song has moved it to.
//
// ⚠️ Which makes the restore on stop() load-bearing rather than tidy. These write engine state that no
// later event puts back, so without it a song that fades out leaves the engine at the faded level, the
// MIXER lies about it, and the next PLAY starts quiet. `Sequencer::mixer_vol_active()` is the flag and
// `SongcoreHost::stop()` is the restore — the shape `eqmActive_` already uses, for the same reason.
constexpr int FX_VTR      = 0x2B;  // VTR  this track's mixer fader (00-FF)
constexpr int FX_VMV      = 0x2C;  // VMV  the master fader (00-FF), global

// ─── The automation pair ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// AUS opens a ramp on the effect in the slot to its LEFT and carries the CURVE; AUF, on a later step
// of the same phrase and track, carries the DESTINATION. The pairing rule, which parameters can be
// ramped and why, all live in `automation.h` — this file only names the two codes.
//
// ⚠️ **NEITHER APPEARS IN `resolve_step_params` BELOW, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN RATHER THAN AN
// OMISSION.** Resolution folds three slots into one bundle last-wins and throws the slot NUMBER away.
// AUS's whole meaning is positional — "the automatable effect nearest to my left" — so a resolved
// bundle cannot express it, and giving it a field would be a field whose value could not answer the
// question. Pairing reads the step's slots directly (`find_ramps`), and both codes fall through
// resolution's default no-op arm exactly as ARP / CHA / RND do.
constexpr int FX_AUS      = 0x2D;  // AUS  automation start: xx = curve (00 ease-in, 80 linear, FF ease-out)
constexpr int FX_AUF      = 0x2E;  // AUF  automation finish: xx = destination value

// ─── The instrument filter, per note ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠️ **BOTH MOVE THE FILTER THE INSTRUMENT DECLARES, AND NEITHER TURNS ONE ON.** They write the
// cutoff/resonance of the voice's own SVF, which an instrument with FILTER TYPE = OFF does not run at
// all — so on such a note they are inert rather than switching on a type the author never typed.
// The value is the same 00-FF byte the INSTRUMENT screen's FREQ and RES cells hold.
//
// Per-note by construction rather than by a restore: a note-on reloads the whole chain from the
// instrument (`SamplerVoice::triggerNote`), so the next note starts at the instrument's own values
// with nothing to put back.
constexpr int FX_CUT      = 0x2F;  // CUT  filter cutoff  (00-FF)
constexpr int FX_RES      = 0x30;  // RES  filter resonance (00-FF)

// ─── The scale commands ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One byte, two nibbles: the high one is the KEY (0 = C … 11 = B) and the low one is the SLOT in the
// project's 16-scale pool. `effect_value_max` caps the pair at 0xBF so the key nibble cannot be typed
// past B — keys 12..15 do not exist, and a cell whose top half selects nothing is a cell that reads
// as broken.
//
// ⚠️ **NEITHER IS SONG STATE — the scale a track is in lives on `TrackState`, exactly as the groove
// does.** The project stores the POOL and the default key; which slot a track has been moved to is a
// property of the take, so it comes back with a LIVE rewind (`Checkpoint::trackState`) and it is gone
// at STOP. Nothing is written to the `.ptp`, and nothing needs to be.
//
// SCG is SCA applied to all eight tracks rather than a second, song-level variable. That is what
// makes it a way BACK: a track moved by SCA has no other route to the song's scale, and a global that
// sat beside the per-track override would leave that track wherever its last SCA put it.
constexpr int FX_SCA      = 0x31;  // SCA  this track's scale: x = key, y = slot
constexpr int FX_SCG      = 0x32;  // SCG  every track's scale, same byte layout

// ─── The filter, switched ON from a cell ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠️ **EACH ONE CARRIES A TYPE AND A CUTOFF TOGETHER, which is exactly what CUT and RES do not.** CUT
// moves the filter the instrument declares; these three declare it. So an instrument whose FILTER TYPE
// is OFF — the state a fresh instrument is in — can be given a filter from the FX column, and CUT/RES
// become reachable on it without a trip to the INSTRUMENT screen first.
//
// ⚠️ **THE TYPE AND THE CUTOFF MUST LAND ON THE SAME FRAME.** They ride ONE bus record — the CC id
// carries the type, its value carries the cutoff — rather than two, because a filter that opens one
// block before it changes shape is an audible click at the head of every sweep.
//
// ⚠️ Three commands, three filters, and NOT a set to widen: the SVF also computes notch and peak, and
// those two are reachable from nowhere at all today. Giving them a door is a one-line change to the
// INSTRUMENT screen's type list, never a fourth and fifth command here.
//
// CUT keeps a job beside them: it moves the cutoff WITHOUT touching the type, which is what a sweep
// over a filter that is already the right one needs.
constexpr int FX_LPF      = 0x33;  // LPF  low-pass ON at this cutoff  (00-FF)
constexpr int FX_HPF      = 0x34;  // HPF  high-pass ON at this cutoff (00-FF)
constexpr int FX_BPF      = 0x35;  // BPF  band-pass ON at this cutoff (00-FF)

/** The FilterModule type an LPF/HPF/BPF cell turns on (1 lp | 2 hp | 3 bp), or 0 for anything else. */
inline constexpr int fx_filter_mode(int code) {
    return code == FX_LPF ? 1 : code == FX_HPF ? 2 : code == FX_BPF ? 3 : 0;
}

// ─── The two dirt commands ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Both write a value the sampler's per-block recompute already reads, so each takes effect while
// the note is still sounding, and each is gone at the next note-on — the same per-note lifetime
// CUT and RES have, and for the same reason: a trigger reseeds them from the instrument.
//
// ⚠️ **0x36 IS RETIRED AND MUST NEVER BE REUSED.** It was a sample-end command, cut before it
// ever shipped: KIL's latency byte already ends a note where the writer wants it, and two ways to
// stop a note early is one too many. A code is a saved cell's identity, so a project written while
// it existed must not read back as something else.
constexpr int FX_DRV      = 0x37;  // DRV  overdrive amount (00 = clean, FF = heavy)

// ⚠️ **ONE CELL, TWO INDEPENDENT 4-BIT VALUES** — the left digit crushes bits, the right one drops the
// sample rate. They are two different kinds of grit, both already 4-bit at the module, so one cell
// carries both rather than two effect codes carrying half-empty bytes each.
//
// ⚠️ **AND THAT IS WHY CRU IS NOT IN THE RAMP REGISTRY.** It would pass the full-range assert — the
// byte really does span 00-FF — but interpolating it sweeps the left digit while the right one wraps
// F→0 sixteen times on the way. The byte is not a quantity, so a ramp over it is not a sweep.
constexpr int FX_CRU      = 0x38;  // CRU  xy: x = bits crushed (0-F), y = downsample (0-F)

/** The two halves of a CRU byte: bits to crush, and the downsample factor. Both 0 = clean. */
inline constexpr int crush_cmd_bits(int value)       { return (value >> 4) & 0x0F; }
inline constexpr int crush_cmd_downsample(int value) { return value & 0x0F; }

// ─── The cents between the semitones ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// PIT moves a note in whole semitones; this fills the gap, one semitone either way in 256 steps of
// 0.78 cents. The two therefore meet with no interval unreachable between them.
//
// ⚠️ **IT RETUNES THE NOTE THAT IS ALREADY SOUNDING**, which is what makes a ramp over it a pitch
// bend of up to a semitone rather than a setting for the next note. On the step that also carries a
// note it lands one frame behind the trigger (`voiceFxFrame`, scheduler.h), so the note it tunes is
// that one — the same ordering CUT, RES and the sends all rely on.
//
// ⚠️ Per-note like those: a trigger reseeds the parameter bus, so the tuning is gone at the next note
// with nothing to restore.
constexpr int FX_FIN      = 0x39;  // FIN  fine tune (00 = a semitone flat, 80 = in tune, FF = sharp)

// ─── How far a step follows the transposes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A SIGNED MULTIPLIER over the transpose the step would otherwise get: 01 normal, 02 twice as far,
// 00 immune, FF the same distance the other way, FE twice as far the other way. Every product is a
// whole number of semitones, so no note can land between two keys and no rounding rule exists to
// disagree about — which is why the multiplier is signed rather than the divisor the request first
// asked for.
//
// ⚠️ **IT SCALES THE CHAIN TSP COLUMN AND THE PROJECT TRANSPOSE TOGETHER**, because those are the
// one quantity the scheduler carries and the same one the instrument's TRANSP. switch silences. A
// command that moved with one and not the other would be a note whose pitch depends on which of two
// screens the transpose was typed on.
//
// ⚠️ It is a PHRASE command with no table arm: a table row runs after its note has already been
// scheduled, and by then the transpose is folded into the pitch and gone. The table-side want the
// request describes — a drum kit that ignores the song transpose — is the instrument's TRANSP.
// switch (model.h), which is read at the same site.
constexpr int FX_TSX      = 0x3A;  // TSX  transpose multiplier (00 immune, 01 normal, FF mirrored)

// ─── The loop window, slid ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⭐⭐ **IT MOVES BOTH ENDS OF THE LOOP TOGETHER, SO THE LOOP'S LENGTH NEVER CHANGES.** That is the
// whole command: on a looped note the loop length is what sets the pitch, so a slider that preserved
// only one end would be a pitch control. What changes is which part of the sample the loop is
// reading — the note holds still and its tone moves.
//
// ⚠️ **THE UNIT IS SIXTEENTHS OF THE LOOP'S OWN LENGTH, SIGNED.** `10` is one whole loop, `01` a
// sixteenth of one, `F0` a whole loop backwards. It is relative to the loop rather than to the file,
// so one cell value does the same musical thing on a short loop and a long one and nobody has to
// count samples. LGPT's equivalent counts raw samples in a 16-bit value; one byte cannot.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ **IT IS CUMULATIVE, AND THE RUNNING TOTAL IS KEPT IN SIXTEENTHS RATHER THAN IN SAMPLES.**
// A loop whose length is not a multiple of 16 makes every step round, and sixteen rounded steps do
// NOT add up to one loop — on a sample of back-to-back single-cycle waves that is a wave boundary
// drifting further out with each step, silent and cumulative. The engine therefore keeps the count
// and derives the sample offset from the TOTAL each block, so sixteen steps of `01` land exactly
// where one step of `10` lands, always.
//
// ⚠️ The window STOPS at each end of the sample rather than wrapping — a wrap makes a drone jump —
// and the count resets on every new note, so one cell colours that note and the next starts clean.
//
// ⭐ `00` is safely "no movement": the command is relative-only, so a zero step has an obvious
// meaning and punches no hole in the range the way LGPT's absolute play-head command does.

/**
 * How many semitones the chain TSP column and the project transpose actually move THIS step, after
 * the instrument's TRANSP. switch and the step's own TSX have had their say.
 *
 * ⭐ **ONE FUNCTION BECAUSE THE SCHEDULER TRANSPOSES A STEP IN THREE PLACES** — the note, a REPEAT
 * retrigger and the arpeggio all read the same figure, and a fourth site added later reads it too.
 * The alternative is three call sites each remembering to ask the same two questions.
 *
 * **TRANSP. off wins over any TSX.** An instrument that does not follow transposition at all is not
 * asking to be moved twice as far; the switch is a property of the sound, the command a property of
 * one step.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A SLICED INSTRUMENT IS NOT A CASE HERE, AND MUST NOT BECOME ONE.** Its slice *selection* is
 * already immune — `voice_derive.h` picks the slice from `note − transpose`, the raw phrase note —
 * while its *pitch* deliberately follows, which is what lets a transposed chain move a chopped break
 * up an octave. Refusing the transpose here would silently take that away. The guard `model.h`
 * asks for around slices is against playing a DIFFERENT SLICE, and that guard is already in place.
 *
 * `instrumentId` is the step's raw instrument column, not a clamped index: an out-of-range or empty
 * column asks no instrument's opinion and transposes exactly as it always did.
