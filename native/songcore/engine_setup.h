// ─── The project → engine push ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything the app does to get a Project *into* the engine: the per-instrument playback params, the
// modulation slots, the EQ/send routing, the mixer, and the global FX state. Ported from
// RenderController.setupInstrumentParams + applyMasterBusForRender and AppInputDispatcher's
// syncVolumesToAudioBackend / pushGlobalEffectsToBackend.
//
// WHY IT HAS TO EXIST (S6b). The engine keeps mixer / master-bus / EQ-bank / send state across project
// swaps — none of it is per-voice — so "play this project" is not just scheduling notes: someone must
// push all of that down first. On Android that someone was Kotlin, which meant a host renderer
// (tools/ptrender) or the SDL shell could not make a sound at all, no matter how correct the
// scheduler was. S7 (deleting the Kotlin path) and Linux Phase 2 need exactly this file.
//
// Two halves, split by lifetime:
//
//   push_project_params  — pure param pushes, no I/O. Cheap, idempotent, safe to repeat. A render
//                          prepares with it; the SDL shell calls it after every load and edit.
//   load_project_media   — opens FILES (samples, SF2s) and *produces* the Routing. Used by ptrender
//                          and the SDL shell. Android still loads media in Kotlin, whose loader also
//                          drives MediaCodec for m4a and reads WAV cue points — see the note there.
//
// Float exactness: every derived value goes through voice_derive.h, whose derivations are byte-
// goldened against the real Kotlin code by tools/ptvoice (77 cases). Nothing is re-derived here.
//
// Template over the engine, like voice_derive.h — AudioEngine satisfies it as-is, and a recorder can
// be substituted in a host test without an interface or a virtual call.

/**
 * The same thing, for an app that is going to PLAY the project rather than export it — every
 * instrument rather than the used ones, and no `resetEffectState()` first (that would cut off whatever
 * is currently ringing).
 *
 * ⚠️ **This closes a real hole, and it is worth being precise about what the hole was.** Until Phase 3
 * S4 the ONLY caller of push_project_params in the whole tree was `prepare_render`. So a rendered WAV
 * carried the project's mixer, master bus, reverb, delay, EQ bank and every sampler's drive / filter /
 * crush / loop / sample window — and the SDL shell PLAYING that same project carried none of it. Live
 * playback ran on whatever the engine happened to hold: its own defaults at startup, or the previous
 * project's settings after a load. It was not audible on the default project (whose values happen to be
 * the engine's own), which is exactly why it survived Phase 2 and three Phase-3 sessions.
 *
 * The reason it could survive at all is that it is invisible to the conformance ladder: ptplay compares
 * EVENTS, and none of this is an event; ptvoice compares the calls a NOTE makes, and none of this is
 * made by a note; ptrender compares audio, and ptrender renders — so it goes through the one path that
 * was correct. Nothing in seven tools looks at what the engine holds while the app is merely running.
 *
 * Call it after a project is loaded, and again whenever a screen edits something in it that the engine
 * keeps on its own (the mixer, the master bus, an instrument's params — SongcoreHost::push_params /
 * push_instrument).

// together with its ~25 `updateXxx(instrument, value)` setters — and those setters are deliberately NOT
// ported: they are `instrument.field = v.coerceIn(...)` plus an engine push, and in C++ the module's
// own `handle_input` does the assignment (as every other screen module already does) and the dispatcher
// makes ONE push afterwards. A controller class whose entire content is "assign, then push" is a layer
// that exists only to be a layer, and porting it would put the model mutation somewhere no golden could
// see it — the pool and MODS modules would then be untestable by ptinput.
//
// ⚠️ The SoundFont path→slot map is NOT ported either, and must not be: it lives in the ENGINE now
// (S6b moved the whole SF bank out of jni-bridge.cpp), which already de-dups by path and evicts LRU.
// Kotlin's `sfSlotMap` is the Kotlin-side shadow of that map. A second copy here would be a second
// truth about which slot a file is in.

// ⚠️ **THESE ASK THE FILE, NOT THE LOADED SLOT, AND THEY HAVE TO.** A slot holds ONE preset cut out
// of the file, so it cannot say what else is in there — and the answer is wanted before anything is
// loaded, and for banks far too large to load at all. Reading the file's index is a few kilobytes and
// touches no sample data; the engine caches it by path.

 * Free every SoundFont slot no instrument is pointing at.

 * `routing.sfSlot[id]` is a single index and the load overwrites it; the preset that was there stays
 * resident with nothing pointing at it, and only LRU eviction — thirteen distinct sounds later — ever
 * reclaims it. Walking a big bank's presets piles up a slotful each, and a slot then emptied by a
 * type change hands back a USED RAM figure that never returns to zero.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ **REFERENCE IS THE ROUTING INDEX, AND DELIBERATELY NOT THE PATH THE INSTRUMENT NAMES.** The
 * obvious version — free a slot no instrument's `soundfontPath` matches — compares path SPELLINGS,
 * and the two loaders spell them differently: `load_project_media` opens through
 * `resolve_media_path`, so a project authored elsewhere leaves its slots holding a re-rooted absolute
 * path while the document still holds what the user wrote. Every slot in such a project reads as
 * unreferenced, and the sweep silences the whole song. `routing.sfSlot` is the app's own record of
 * which slot an instrument is using, is written by all three loaders, and carries no spelling.
 *
 * ⚠️ It is one-directional on purpose. A stale index — one left pointing at a slot LRU eviction has
 * since given to somebody else — protects that slot from this sweep, which is the harmless way to be
 * wrong: the cost is a slot not reclaimed, never a slot pulled out from under a sounding voice.
 *
 * It is what `set_instrument_type` and `clear_instrument` used to ask about one slot with a
 * hand-rolled loop over the pool; those callers clear their own index first and the sweep then finds
 * everything the instrument was the last owner of, rather than only the one the index named.
