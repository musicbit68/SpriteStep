// ─── The EXTERNAL consumer — bus events become MIDI bytes ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The mirror image of engine_consumer.h. That one turns a bus record into engine calls; this one turns
// the SAME record into bytes on a cable, and neither knows the other exists. MIDI plan §4.3.
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE IS PLATFORM-FREE, and the seam that keeps it so is `IMidiOut` — five methods, the
// smallest surface that can list, open and write to a port. Every platform difference lives behind it
// (Linux: ALSA rawmidi; Windows: winmm; Android: a JNI up-call into `MidiManager`, which is the only
// sanctioned route to USB/BLE/virtual devices there — see the plan §4.3 for why AMidi does not help).
// That is the same shape `AudioBackend` has, for the same reason.
//
// ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY IN ONE PLACE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   • **the 0–255/0–1 ↔ 0–127 scaling** (`to7bit`). The plan names it a risk in §11: internal params
//     are wider than the wire, and a second conversion written somewhere else is how internal and
//     external behaviour drift apart without either looking wrong.
//   • **the routing verdict** (`instrument_routes_external` + `TrackInstruments`, router.h). Both
//     consumers ask the same question of the same state.
//   • **the note lifecycle.** One active note per track, always, whatever ends it — a LEN gate, the
//     next note, a KIL, or the transport stopping. An external synth has no voice allocator to save
//     us: a note-on we fail to answer sounds until the power is cut.
//   • **the route to the wire.** Since phase C there are two producers — this serializer and the
//     `MidiClock` below — and they share `emit`, the OFFSET, the port and the send observer. The clock
//     hands its bytes to a sink rather than holding a port of its own, for exactly that reason.
//
// ── TIMING, AND WHO CALLS `pump` (phase B3) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Events arrive at LOOKAHEAD time — the scheduler runs two phrases (~4 s) ahead — so they are queued
// against their target frame and released by `pump(now)`. `pump` is called from wherever the frame
// clock is read: until B3 that was the host's 60 Hz poll, which quantised every send to ~16 ms. Since
// B3 it is a dedicated sender thread (`shell/midi-sender.{h,cpp}`) running at ~1 kHz against
// `FrameEstimator` (songcore/frame_estimator.h), and `SongcoreHost::poll` pumps only when no such
// thread has claimed the job — one owner of "who releases the queue", the same rule B4.3 applied to
// "who opens the port".
//
// ⚠️ **THE PLAN SAID THIS WOULD CHANGE THIS FILE "NOT AT ALL". THAT WAS A HYPOTHESIS AND IT WAS
// WRONG** — a mechanism in a ratified plan is a hypothesis (the guardrails' own rule). `pump` taking
// its `now` as an argument is indeed all the SEAM needed, but a second thread calling it made this
// class's state shared, and shared state needs a lock. Hence `mu_` below. Everything else about the
// serializer, the queue and the note lifecycle is genuinely unchanged.
