// ─── The offline render ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// RenderController's orchestration, in C++: ready the engine, render the scheduled span in chunks,
// let the tail ring out, stream it to a WAV, put the engine back. Ported in S6b because
// `renderToWavFile` was a Kotlin *private fun* — so tools/ptrender and the SDL shell had nothing to
// drive the engine with, and S7 would have had to write it a second time anyway.
//
// The scheduler is NOT part of this. prepare → (someone schedules) → render is three steps precisely
// so that Android can still schedule with the KOTLIN sequencer while everything around it is shared
// C++ — which is what keeps the ENG=KT vs ENG=C++ byte-identical WAV comparison honest: it isolates
// the sequencer as the only difference between the two renders.
//
// TWO USER-FACING BUGS ARE FIXED HERE (both found by the S5 device test, both older than songcore).
// The rule, from the user: "DSPs SHOULD have the tails at the END of a render — that's the whole
// point of reverb and delay. But their tails SHOULDN'T be picked up at the START of a new render."
// It used to be backwards on both counts:
//
//   (a) THE START INHERITED HISTORY. stopAll() stops voices but never touched the effect chains, so a
//       render began inside the previous one's reverb tail, delay buffer and OTT/limiter envelopes —
//       and because ReverbSc's random-lineseg LCG kept walking, the same song rendered DIFFERENTLY
//       every time. prepare_render now calls AudioEngine::resetEffectState() and re-pushes the whole
//       project (engine_setup.h). A render is now a pure function of the project, which is also what
//       makes ptrender's determinism check possible at all.
//
//   (b) THE END TRUNCATED ITS OWN TAIL. The render stopped dead at the scheduler's span — the last
//       step's boundary — so every WAV was cut mid-waveform: no note release, no reverb tail, no
//       delay repeats, plus a click. (Measured on a device render: the file ended at 100% of the
//       whole render's peak.) render_to_wav now keeps going until the output has decayed below
//       −90 dBFS, capped so a runaway feedback delay cannot render forever.
//
//   (c) …AND THEN NOTHING ENDED THE NOTES. A looping sample and a held SoundFont note do not decay,
//       so waiting for the output to fall below −90 dBFS waited for the runaway cap: every such song
//       exported to a file with TAIL_MAX_SECONDS of leftover ringing on the end, cut mid-waveform
//       when it expired. The sequence running out now releases every track (scheduleReleaseAll) at
//       the frame the last step ends on, so what follows the music is what a listener would expect
//       to follow it — the notes' own release envelopes, the reverb and the delay repeats.
//
// Live playback cannot be affected by any of this: resetEffectState()'s only callers are here.
