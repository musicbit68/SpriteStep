// ─── The scheduler's random source ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The C++ twin of kotlin.random.Random, for the four random FX: CHA (the chance gate), RND and RNL
// (randomize an FX value, or a note + instrument), and ARP mode 3 (RANDOM). Until S7 these draws
// were stubs — rng_int() returned 0 and rng_range() returned its low bound — so every one of them
// took not merely the same branch each time but the LOWEST value: CHA passed whenever its
// probability nibble was nonzero, RND/RNL always emitted the bottom of their range, and a random
// arpeggio always played the root. Correct-looking, and completely wrong.
//
// WHY THIS IS THE ONE PIECE OF SONGCORE THAT IS NOT GOLDEN-COMPARED.
//
// Every other layer is proven by byte-equality against the Kotlin original. This one cannot be:
// Kotlin's `Random.Default` is seeded from the platform, so the KOTLIN sequencer does not produce
// the same sequence twice either. There is no draw-for-draw ground truth to match, and cloning
// Kotlin's generator ALGORITHM would buy nothing — a stream nobody can predict is not a stream
// anybody can compare. What must match — and what tools/ptrandom does check against the real Kotlin
// implementation, before it is deleted — is the *distribution*:
//
//   • the SUPPORT: the exact set of values a draw can produce. This is where the bugs live. An
//     off-by-one, a closed interval where Kotlin's is half-open, or a stub pinned to the low end,
//     all show up here as a missing or extra value — exactly, and with no statistics involved.
//   • the SHAPE: uniform over that support.
//
// So the API below mirrors kotlin.random.Random's CONTRACT, bound for bound:
//
//     Kotlin                           songcore                  used by
//     Random.nextInt(bound)       →    next_int(bound)           CHA roll: nextInt(15) → 0..14
//     Random.nextInt(from, until) →    next_int(from, until)     RND/RNL value, RNL note/inst offset
//     listOf(a, b, c).random()    →    next_int(3) as an index   ARP RANDOM
//
// Half-open at the top, and `from` may be NEGATIVE — RNL draws its note and instrument offsets as
// nextInt(-range, range + 1), i.e. the inclusive band [-range, +range]. Get either end wrong and the
// FX quietly loses a semitone at one edge, which no ear and no golden would ever catch.
//
// Seeding matches Kotlin's default too: a fresh Sequencer seeds itself from the platform, so two
// runs of the same song differ — as they always have on the Kotlin path. That is why the audio
// golden (g7) is built to avoid random FX entirely, and why a render containing them is not
// reproducible on EITHER engine. seed() exists so the conformance tool can make its own measurement
// repeatable; the app never calls it.
//
// Real-time safe: no allocation, no locks, no syscalls once constructed.
