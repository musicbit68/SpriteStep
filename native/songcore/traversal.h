// ─── Static song traversal ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1:1 port of core/logic/SongTraversal.kt: the shared song → chain → phrase → step walk used for
// STATIC analysis of the song (e.g. "which instruments does this row range use?"), applying the same
// bounds guards every time so the copies can't drift. This is deliberately NOT the live scheduler's
// walk (that goes by playback position / HOP / checkpoints — songcore S4) and NOT CLEAN's whole-song
// collector (which counts muted tracks as used and gathers more ref kinds).
//
// SongTraversal.kt is the executable spec. tools/ptresolve proves collect_used_instruments against a
// JVM golden over the real /tools/testdata projects.
