// ─── The songcore runtime ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The object an application owns to make songcore play: it holds the Project, the bus (MidiRouter),
// the Sequencer, and the trace sink, and it exposes exactly the verb set the event-schema §7 JNI
// vocabulary names — push the song, play/stop, poll, read back playheads. Phase 1 S5.
//
// PLATFORM-FREE ON PURPOSE. The only thing outside songcore it knows is AudioEngine (audio-engine.h),
// which is the *portable* engine core — no <jni.h>, no <oboe/*>, no <android/*> anywhere in this
// header. That is the whole point: the Android JNI shell (songcore-jni.cpp) is a thin marshalling
// layer over this class, and the SDL shell will construct the same class the same way. Nothing that
// decides how the song sounds lives above this line on either platform.
//
// Threading: single-threaded by contract. Every verb is called from the app's UI/transport thread
// (on Android: the Compose poll loop + input handlers), never from the audio callback. The engine
// calls it makes (scheduleNote…, clearScheduledNotesFrom) are the same ones the Kotlin sequencer made
// from that same thread — they land in the engine's lock-free queues, which is the existing contract.
//
// S6b closed the last gap: project→engine setup (engine_setup.h) and the offline render (render.h)
// are C++ too, so this class can now take a project from JSON all the way to a WAV with no app code
// at all — which is what tools/ptrender does, and what the SDL shell will do. The one thing still
// outside it is Android's *media* loading (samples/SF2 from disk): the Kotlin loader also drives
// MediaCodec for m4a and reads WAV cue points, so it stays for now and pushes its results down via
// push_routing(). load_media() is the C++ equivalent, used by every non-Android caller.

     * `isPlaying_ == false`) scheduled a SECOND stream on top of the stale one. That is what "layered"
     * playback was: two live schedules in one queue, not the voice allocator.
     *
     * ⚠️ THE ASSUMPTION WAS TRUE WHEN IT WAS MADE. On Android this host is only ever reached through
     * `PlaybackController.stop()`, which does the engine-side cleanup itself immediately afterwards —
     * and says so: *"songcore resets its own transport, per-track state and master EQ; the engine-side
     * cleanup below (queues, voices) is shared and runs for both engines"* (PlaybackController.kt:415).
     * It was shared right up until the SDL shell called `host_.stop()` with no PlaybackController under
     * it. The layer built on top invalidated the assumption, in a channel nothing was pointed at.
     * Android's calls are now redundant rather than wrong — both verbs are idempotent.
     *
     * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING, and it is Kotlin's: the master EQ is restored BEFORE the queues are
     * cleared, because the EQM override lives in the param queue — drop those entries first and the bus
     * stays stuck on the last EQM preset forever. Guarded on a live project: the render path leaves
     * `currentProject_` null and restores its own master EQ in RenderController.
     *
     * `play_song`/`play_chain`/`play_phrase` deliberately do NOT call this. Kotlin's play* verbs each
     * open with `stop()`, but on both platforms the caller has already done it — the shell's `on_start`
     * stops before it starts (input_dispatcher.cpp), and the JNI's caller is that same

     *
     *   1. ⚠️ **THE BUS'S ORDERING INVARIANT.** `TrackInstruments` (router.h) assumes events arrive per
     *      track in NON-DECREASING frame order, which the sequencer guarantees because it schedules
     *      forward. A live key is stamped `clock + 100` while the lookahead has already emitted records
     *      up to two phrases into the future — so a key pressed mid-song would arrive *behind* records
     *      already dispatched. The consumers each keep their own map and are handed the record
     *      directly, which is the only arrangement in which that is harmless.
     *   2. **THE TRACE.** `writer_` is a bus consumer and the 36 goldens have never contained a live
     *      event. A key press is not part of the song, exactly as a preview is not.
     *   3. There is nothing to gain: the two consumers below ARE the bus's audio subscribers.
     *
     * ── WHAT EACH CONSUMER IS ASKED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     *
     * `consume` is the ONE DOOR on both (B5's `preview_note_off` says why): each answers the routing
     * gate itself, resolves the record's owner through its own `TrackInstruments`, and honours the LEN
     * gate — so a live key and a sequenced note cannot disagree about who owns a track.
     *
     *   • the ENGINE consumer, **unconditionally and whichever way the instrument routes**. Its gate
     *     drops EXTERNAL records, and its internal→external arm is the one that ends a voice a flip
     *     would otherwise leave sounding.
     *   • the CABLE, only when THRU is on — see `set_midi_in_thru`. A suppressed record is COUNTED,
