// ANDROID AUDIO BACKEND — the ONLY Oboe-coupled translation unit.
// Owns the output stream and IS its oboe::AudioStreamDataCallback. On each callback it hands the raw
// buffer to the portable AudioEngine core via processLiveBlock(); all DSP/scheduling lives in the core
// (audio-engine.{h,cpp}), which has no Oboe/Android dependency. A Linux port adds a sibling backend
// (e.g. AlsaAudioEngine) that drives the same core the same way — the core stays untouched.

// `AudioBackend` since convergence C3 — the shared shell (shell/app.cpp) reaches its device through
// those six methods and nothing else, so `shell/android-main.cpp` hands it one of these where the
// desktop hands it an `SdlAudioEngine` and app.cpp does not change a character. The interface was
// derived from SdlAudioEngine's shape and this class already matched three of it; see
// native/audio-backend.h for why the virtuals cost nothing (they are lifecycle, never the callback).
//
// Constructed by `android-main.cpp`'s `main()` for the SDL app — the one owner since convergence
// Phase E deleted the JNI facade (`jni-bridge.cpp`) that used to build a separate instance for the
// Compose app. Nothing here is a singleton and nothing here may become one.

     * first, these two values are the only thing standing between the stream and a resampler.

     * `resumeStream()` above restarts the stream whenever it finds it in `Paused` — and the engine
     * calls `requestResume()` before *every scheduled note* (audio-engine.h:99). So a paused stream
     * is one note-on away from being restarted by the engine itself, in the middle of the render this
     * call exists to protect, from a code path that has no idea a render is happening. Stopping puts
     * the stream in `Stopped`, which `resumeStream`'s check does not match, so the restart cannot
     * happen behind the render's back. Choosing pause here would have compiled, run, and reopened
     * exactly the race this method closes.
     *
     * The engine's own `isOfflineRendering` flag already makes `processLiveBlock` return silence
     * without touching `processAudioBlock` — so what this adds is the window between setting that
     * flag and the last in-flight callback returning. `stop()` blocks on the state transition, which
     * is Oboe's equivalent of `SDL_PauseAudioDevice` blocking until the callback has returned.
