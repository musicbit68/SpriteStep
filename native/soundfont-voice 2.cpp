// TinySoundFont — single-header SF2/SF3 renderer (MIT license)
// NOTE: TSF_IMPLEMENTATION must be defined in exactly one .cpp file

// ⚠️ **THIS INCLUDE IS WHAT DECODES COMPRESSED SAMPLE DATA, AND IT MUST COME FIRST.** A compressed
// soundfont's `smpl` chunk holds Ogg Vorbis frames, and both of tsf's paths for them —
// `tsf_decode_sf3_samples` and `tsf_decode_ogg` — sit behind `#ifdef STB_VORBIS_INCLUDE_STB_VORBIS_H`,
// which is stb_vorbis's own include guard. Without it those two functions are never compiled, and
// tsf's `#else` arm has NO FORMAT CHECK: it converts the chunk in place as raw 16-bit PCM, so the file
// loads and then renders noise.
//
// ⚠️ It is needed for more than the `.sf3` the browser offers: tsf picks the decoder off each shdr's
// compression flag, not off the extension, so a file NAMED `.sf2` can carry Vorbis samples. Removing
// this include to follow whatever the extension list currently says would make such a file load and
// render noise, silently.
//
// Declarations only. stb_vorbis is compiled as its own C translation unit (see CMakeLists.txt), so
// STB_VORBIS_HEADER_ONLY avoids a second copy of the implementation, and extern "C" makes these C++
// references resolve against the C-compiled symbols. Same shape as audio-decoders.cpp.

// ─── The memory guard on a soundfont load ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠️⚠️ **WITHOUT THIS, A FONT TOO BIG FOR THE MACHINE KILLS THE APP AND NOTHING SAYS WHY.** tsf
// null-checks its allocations and unwinds to a null return, but the null never arrives: measured on
// a shipping device, bionic GRANTED a 256 GB request on a 7.36 GB machine. `malloc` never refuses,
// the request succeeds against untouched address space, and the kernel kills the process the moment
// the pages are written.
//
// ⭐ **So this does not ESTIMATE anything — it MEASURES.** There is nothing in an SF3 header that
// states its decoded size (tsf only learns it by decoding), so a prediction was never available for
// the format that needs one most. Asking the machine how much is actually free, at the moment a
// large block is about to be taken, needs no header and is exact for both formats at once.
//
// ⭐ tsf documents `TSF_MALLOC`/`TSF_REALLOC`/`TSF_FREE` as override points (tsf.h:13), so the guard
// itself needs no edit to the vendored file, and the refusal lands on tsf's own null checks.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ **BUT ONE OF THOSE UNWIND PATHS WAS WRONG, AND MAKING THE ALLOCATOR SAY NO IS WHAT EXPOSED
// IT.** `tsf_decode_ogg` freed the CALLER's buffer and returned 0; the caller freed it again — a
// double free, reachable only when a realloc fails, which under overcommit it never did. It is fixed
// in `tsf.h` and is the **THIRD** local change to vendored tsf, all three of which must be re-applied
// on any update. ⭐ The lesson to keep: **a dormant error path is not a working one, and a guard that
// makes a never-taken branch reachable inherits every bug in it.**
//
// ⚠️⚠️ **AND THE QUANTITY IT MEASURES IS `old + new`, NOT `new`** — see the block table below. A
// guard that measured only the requested size approved the step that killed the process, because a
// `realloc` holds both blocks at once. That, and tsf's growth factor (1.5x rather than 2x, in
// tsf.h), are what a font the machine can very nearly hold turns on.
//
// ⚠️ Only allocations at or above `SF_GUARD_MIN_BYTES` are checked. `/proc/meminfo` costs ~50 us to
// read and tsf makes thousands of small allocations for its preset and region tables; the ones that
// can exhaust a machine are the sample buffers, and those are enormous. A small allocation cannot be
// the one that kills us, so measuring before it is cost with no answer attached.
//
// ⚠️ **`available_memory_bytes()` returning 0 means UNKNOWN and must never refuse.** A platform that
// cannot answer has to keep loading exactly as it does today, or the guard turns into a total outage
// on whatever port reads it wrong.
