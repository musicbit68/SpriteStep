/**
 * ⚠️ **THERE IS NO SIZE LIMIT ON A SOUNDFONT, AND A LIMIT ON `.sf3` ALONE WOULD BE THE WRONG SHAPE.**
 * This is written down because it looks like an obvious thing to add.
 *
 * The two formats are the same font with the sample data compressed or not, and they end at the same
 * float buffer. Measured on a 3000-sample font decoding to 410 MB of float:
 *
 *   | | file | load | peak RSS |
 *   |---|---|---|---|
 *   | `.sf2` | 205 MB | 1.24 s | **825 MB** |
 *   | `.sf3` |  14 MB | 3.60 s | **443 MB** |
 *
 * SF3 costs about 3× the load time and **half the peak memory**, because the SF2 path holds the whole
 * raw `smpl` chunk alongside the float buffer while SF3's raw chunk is a fourteenth of the size. So
 * capping SF3 by file size refuses the cheaper of the two and admits the more expensive one — and it
 * would do it at a threshold nothing can derive, since **nothing in an SF3 header states the decoded
 * size**: tsf only learns it by decoding.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ **AND NOTHING BOUNDS IT AT THE ALLOCATOR EITHER — DO NOT ASSUME A FAILED LOAD FAILS CLEANLY.**
 * tsf does null-check every allocation it makes, so the unwind path is real; what is missing is the
 * null. Measured: **bionic granted a 256 GB request on a 7.36 GB device**, so on Android there is no
 * size at which `malloc` refuses and `tsf_load` cannot return null for want of memory — the process
 * is killed on the write instead, with no message and no autosave. glibc does refuse, but only above
 * `MemTotal + SwapTotal`: it refuses against the size of the whole machine, never against what is
 * free. Only Windows (real commit accounting) and 32-bit armhf (3 GB of address space) fail cleanly.
 *
 * What bounds it instead is a check against the DEVICE's free memory, made where the memory actually
 * grows: a counting `TSF_MALLOC`/`TSF_REALLOC` for both font formats (`soundfont-voice.cpp`),
 * `decode_has_room()` for compressed samples (`audio-decoders.cpp`), and `load_budget_bytes()` up
 * front for WAV — the one source whose decoded size a header states. ⚠️ Deliberately NOT an estimate
 * made before opening the file: that would re-parse what the loaders already parse, and **no SF3
 * header carries the decoded size at all** — tsf only learns it by decoding. The limit is therefore
 * derived per-device from the file as it loads, which is why a fixed cap on one format is still the
 * wrong shape.
 *
 * ⚠️ A load the user is WATCHING — opening a project, applying a preset — is still synchronous on the
 * drawing thread, and reports itself through `load_progress.h` while it runs. The one that is not is
 * the PATCH row's, which has no bar and must not have one; see `requestSoundfontLoad`.

    // have had to reimplement the slot cache. The JNI functions are now thin forwards to these.
    //
    // ⭐ **ONE PRESET IS LOADED, NOT THE WHOLE FILE.** The chosen preset is cut out of the file into a
    // small in-memory SoundFont (soundfont-trim.h) and that is what tsf parses, so a 200 MB orchestral
    // bank costs the few megabytes of the one sound in use instead of 400 MB of everything else. A file
    // this cannot cut apart falls back to loading it whole, which is the old behaviour exactly.
    //

    // onto its existing slot (instruments sharing a handle play on distinct MIDI channels and apply
    // their ADSR override per-note, so their state stays isolated), and one more distinct sound than
    // there are slots evicts the least-recently-used one.
