// ⚠️ OFF ANDROID THERE IS NO LOGCAT TO FILTER THESE. On Android LOGD is a debug-priority line that a
// user never sees; here the same 35 call sites go straight to stderr — which, in a shipped desktop
// build, is the console window sitting behind the tracker. A2's first-run experience was a wall of
//
//     [D/NativeAudio] 🔊 Track 0 volume set to 1.00
//
// on every boot, with the emoji arriving as mojibake on any console that is not UTF-8 (which is
// main.cpp's own stated ASCII rule, broken by a header that predates it). The PortMaster build has
// always done this too; nobody noticed because a handheld's stderr goes nowhere anyone looks.
//
// So LOGD is OPT-IN off Android:  SPRITESTEP_LOG=1 ./spritestep-sdl
// Anything but unset/empty/"0" turns it on, matching how SPRITESTEP_HOME is read.
//
// ⚠️ LOGE IS NOT GATED, deliberately. An error is not spam, and a shipped build that swallows its
// errors is worse than one that is chatty — the whole reason the console is worth keeping is that a
// user can paste it back when something breaks.
//
// ⚠️ A PLAIN BOOL READ ONCE, not getenv() per call. getenv allocates nothing but walks the
// environment and is not real-time safe, and while processAudioBlock currently contains no log call
// at all (checked), the control-path functions that do are reachable from queue drains. A C++17
// inline variable is initialised before main, so every LOGD after start-up costs one predictable
// branch on an already-hot bool — cheaper than today's unconditional fprintf, and safe if a log
// line ever does land on the audio thread.
