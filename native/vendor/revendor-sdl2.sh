# Re-vendor SDL2 into native/vendor/SDL2 at a given release tag.
#
#   native/vendor/revendor-sdl2.sh release-2.30.9
#
# ─── Why this is a SCRIPT and not a paragraph in a README ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# The vendored copy is a PRUNED subset of upstream (80 MB whole, 21 MB of it actually reachable by
# the CMake build), and the pruning rule is the kind of thing that survives exactly one upgrade if it
# lives in prose. Whoever next bumps SDL would re-clone, copy "the source", and either drag 51 MB of
# test/ back in or — much worse — copy a subset that differs from this one in some way nobody
# notices until an unrelated backend fails to compile six months later.
#
# So the rule is executable. Bumping SDL is: run this with the new tag, look at the diff, commit.
#
# ⚠️ THE JAVA GLUE COMES FROM THE SAME CHECKOUT AS THE C, AND THAT IS THE ENTIRE POINT.
# SDL's Android support is half C and half Java, and the two halves are version-locked:
# SDLActivity.java hardcodes SDL_MAJOR/MINOR/MICRO_VERSION and compares them against the C library's
# nativeGetVersion() at startup, refusing to run on a mismatch. Mixing versions is a classic
# SDL-on-Android failure that presents as an inscrutable init crash. Copying both halves out of ONE
# clone in ONE script makes drift structurally impossible rather than a thing to remember — and
# native/CMakeLists.txt re-asserts it at BUILD time (search for SDL_VERSION_LOCK) so that a hand-edit
# of either half cannot get past a compile.
#
# ⚠️ THIS COPY IS ANDROID-ONLY, BY DESIGN, AND IS NOT THE SHELL'S SDL.
# shell/CMakeLists.txt takes the SYSTEM SDL2 when it can (every PortMaster CFW requires that — the
# device's own libSDL2 carries that hardware's display/audio patches) and FetchContent otherwise.
# The APK cannot do either: F-Droid builds offline from source with no prebuilt binaries, so Android
# is the one target that has to carry SDL in-tree. Two delivery models for two linkage models, which
# is why the pruning below can drop the desktop backends' build plumbing (wayland-protocols/,
# build-scripts/) without breaking anything that is actually built.

# ⚠️ core.autocrlf=false ON THE CLONE, and it is not a nicety. This repo sets core.autocrlf=true
# globally, so a plain clone here hands back every SDL source file with CRLF line endings — 2117 CRs
# injected into SDLActivity.java alone. Combined with the `* -text` .gitattributes written below
# (which stores bytes verbatim), that would commit a CRLF-ified SDL into the repo and ship it to
# every Linux and F-Droid checkout. It compiles, so nothing would ever complain.
#
# ⚠️⚠️ AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS SCRIPT COULD NOT SEE IT. Its check diffed the vendored copy
# against the clone it was made from — both converted by the same setting — so the comparison passed
# while "byte-identical to upstream" was false. A check that compares two things corrupted the same
# way is not a check. That is why the verification at the bottom now compares GIT BLOB HASHES
# against upstream's own object IDs, which no local EOL setting can influence.

# is the narrower one: the vendored tree contains exactly one binary file, a WinRT cursor resource,

# SDL2 — vendored for the Android build

**Do not edit anything in this directory.** It is a pruned but otherwise **verbatim** copy of
upstream SDL2, produced by \`native/vendor/revendor-sdl2.sh\`. To change the version, run that
script with a new tag; to change what is copied, edit the script.

| | |
|---|---|
| upstream | https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL |
| tag | \`$TAG\` |
| commit | \`$SDL_COMMIT\` |
| licence | zlib — \`LICENSE.txt\`, and \`docs/licenses/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md\` |

## Why this exists at all

The SDL shell on desktop and on the handhelds does **not** use this copy: \`shell/CMakeLists.txt\`
links the *system* SDL2 where there is one (mandatory on PortMaster CFWs) and FetchContent's it
otherwise. Only the APK needs SDL in-tree, because F-Droid builds offline, from source, with no
prebuilt binaries — see convergence plan C1.

## What was dropped

\`test/\` (51 MB), \`Xcode*/\`, \`VisualC*/\`, \`visualtest/\`, \`docs/\`, \`acinclude/\`,
\`build-scripts/\`, \`wayland-protocols/\`, \`android-project-ant/\`, \`mingw/\`,
\`src/hidapi/testgui/\`, and all of \`android-project/\` except the Java glue, which is flattened
into \`android/java/\`. \`src/\` itself is **not** pruned per-platform: SDL's own CMake decides which
backends compile, and a hand-pruned \`src/\` turns every future SDL option into a missing-file error.

## The one rule

⚠️ **The C and the Java are version-locked.** \`android/java/org/libsdl/app/SDLActivity.java\`
hardcodes the SDL version and refuses to run against a \`libSDL2.so\` reporting a different one.
Both halves come out of one clone here, and \`native/CMakeLists.txt\` re-checks them against each
other at build time (\`SDL_VERSION_LOCK\`). Never update one by hand.
PROV

# ─── Prove the copy is upstream's, by GIT BLOB HASH ────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every file gets hashed with `git hash-object` and compared against the object ID upstream's own
# tree records for that path. That is the strongest available statement of "these are upstream's
# bytes": the blob ID is a hash of the content, computed identically everywhere, and no
# core.autocrlf, no core.eol, no platform and no editor can make a changed file hash the same.
#
# ⚠️ This replaces a `diff -r` against the clone, which LOOKED equivalent and was not: it compared
# the copy with the source it was copied from, so any corruption applied to BOTH — exactly what
# core.autocrlf does — passed silently. A negative control that cannot fail is not a control, and
# this one was measured failing to fail: the tree it certified had 2117 CRs injected into
# SDLActivity.java alone.
