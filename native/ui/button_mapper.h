// ─── THE COMBO MATRIX ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `ButtonEvent` in, one named dispatcher handler out. The C++ twin of `InputMapper.handleButtonAction`
// (input/ButtonHandlers.kt:402), and the first arrow of Android's InputMapper → ButtonHandlers →
// AppInputDispatcher chain.
//
// ── WHY THIS MOVED, AND WHY IT IS A TEMPLATE (convergence C0.1) ──────────────────────────────────
//
// It lived in `shell/main.cpp`'s anonymous namespace from Phase 3 S1 until convergence C0, where it
// had two properties that were fine for a Linux port and are not fine for a shared shell:
//
//   • **it existed in exactly one copy, in a file Android cannot link.** C1 gives Android the same
//     SDL shell, and the identical matrix has to run there. A second copy is the drift Phase 3 spent
//     itself killing;
//   • ⚠️ **no tool could reach it.** `tools/ptdispatch` drives the dispatcher's *named handlers*
//     directly — one layer BELOW this function — so every assertion it makes starts after the
//     question this file answers. A block whose own comment says "the order of these checks IS the
//     specification" had no coverage of that order at all, on either side: Kotlin's
//     `handleButtonAction` is equally untooled (tools/testdata/README.md §3 names it as an uncovered hole),
//     which is why there is no golden to compare against and `tools/ptmapper` asserts instead.
//
// The template parameter is what fixes the second one, and it costs nothing: `Dispatcher` is
// `InputDispatcher` in every shipping build (no virtual call, no indirection, the same code
// generated as when this took a concrete reference), and `tools/ptmapper` instantiates it with a stub
// that records which handler was called instead of doing it. That stub is the only reason the order
// below can be measured rather than re-read.
//
// ⚠️ **A `Dispatcher` must provide every `on_*` named below plus `defer_a_to_release()`,
// `defer_b_to_release()`, `on_a_deferred()` and `help_full_open()`.** A template only type-checks what
// it instantiates, so a typo here is caught by the shell's own instantiation (which is a full build,
// every session) and by ptmapper's.

/**
 * The COMBO MATRIX — a 1:1 port of `InputMapper.handleButtonAction`, and the last piece of the input
 * chain that is allowed to be platform-specific.
 *
 * Android's chain is InputMapper → ButtonHandlers → AppInputDispatcher. This function is the first
 * arrow: it owns nothing but the question "which of the ~30 named handlers does this press mean?",
 * and it answers it from the button plus the modifiers held at the instant it happened. Everything
 * downstream — what a handler DOES — is `pt::ui::InputDispatcher`, which is portable C++ and has never
 * heard of SDL.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE ORDER OF THESE CHECKS IS THE SPECIFICATION.** They run most-specific-first, and each arm
 * RETURNS. L+B+A must be tested before L+A or a clone would paste; A+B before a plain A or a delete
 * would insert; R+A and R+B — MUTE and SOLO — before the plain A and B arms, or holding R to change
 * screens would fire an edit underneath. Reordering them silently changes what the tracker does.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The modifiers come from the EVENT, never from `input.is_held()`.** See ui/buttons.h: SDL delivers
 * a frame's worth of events at once, so a poll-time read describes the end of the frame rather than the
 * instant of each event — and B-then-A inside one 16 ms frame would fire A+B (delete) on the B press.
