//
// The portable implementation of ui/filesystem.h — the one the SDL shell and every host tool use. It
// is the counterpart of `platform/android/AndroidFileSystem.kt`, and the only thing it does not
// inherit from it is *where the root is*: Android hard-codes `Documents/SPRITESTEP` (it must — that
// is the one place scoped storage lets it write and the user browse), while here the root is handed in
// by the shell, because a handheld has no Documents directory and a test wants a temp one.
//
// Everything under the root has the SAME seven names as Android, and that is not cosmetic: a user who
// copies their `SPRITESTEP/` folder off a phone and onto an SD card must find their projects where
// the app looks for them.

     * The two-root form: `root` is the user's media tree, `private_root` is where the app's own
     * `settings.json`, `template.ptp` and `autosave.ptp` live.
     *
     * ⚠️ **They differ on Android alone, and only because the media tree there is not guaranteed to be
     * readable at boot.** Those three files are read before the UI exists — before any folder has been
     * granted, and on a fresh install there is no granted folder at all. A settings file that cannot be
     * read at boot is one that gets overwritten with the factory defaults at quit, which is precisely
     * the failure `load_settings`'s two-meaning `false` was built to distinguish. So Android hands in
     * `context.filesDir`: app-private, needs no permission, and survives the media tree being absent,
     * unreadable or revoked.
     *
     * ⚠️ **`config.json` stays under `root`, not here**, and that is a decision rather than an
     * oversight: it is the one app file the *user* hand-edits, and app-private storage is reachable
     * only over adb. `load_folder_config` already treats "no file" as its common case, so a media tree
     * that is not there yet reads exactly like a config that was never written.
     *
     * Every non-Android caller passes the same string twice — the one-argument constructor above — and
     * behaves identically to a build that had never heard of a private root.

 * ⚠️ Windows and macOS choose Documents where Linux chooses a data directory, and that is deliberate,
 * not an inconsistency: a handheld has no Documents folder and its user reaches files over the SD card,
 * while a desktop user reaches them through a file manager. It is the same reasoning that put Android's
 * root under `/Documents/SPRITESTEP`, and it keeps the seven folder names identical on all four.
