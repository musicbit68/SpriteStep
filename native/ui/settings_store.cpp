    //
    // ⚠️⚠️ **THESE ARE READ AND WRITTEN ON EVERY PLATFORM WHILE NO PLATFORM DISPLAYS THEM, AND THAT IS
    // DELIBERATE.** This file's header states the rule they appear to break — "only the rows the shell
    // actually HAS are persisted", because writing a value for a question the platform never asked is
    // inventing an answer. C6 is the case that rule anticipated in its own next sentence: *"if Android
    // ever converges onto this UI it brings its own answers with it — and its own keys."* This is that,
    // arriving one phase before the rows do.
    //
    // The ordering is forced, and it is the whole reason these land now rather than in Phase D. The
    // one-shot prefs import (`SdlActivity.importLegacySettings`) runs BEFORE native boot and writes
    // these keys into settings.json. If `serialize_settings` did not know them, the very first quit
    // would rewrite the file without them and the user's BTN SOUND / VIBRO / overlay strength would be
    // gone — silently, between the import that rescued them and the phase that finally shows them.
    // A key that is written by one component and dropped by another is worse than a key nobody writes.
    //
    // ⚠️ SKIN is now persisted, as a STABLE STRING — this is the "Phase D second pass" the deferral
    // below anticipated. `portrait_skin` (matching Android's SharedPreferences key) survives the shell's
    // skin list being reordered; the shell resolves the name to an index at boot (device_skin.h). An
    // absent key keeps the default, which is what an upgrading user's file has until they touch it.
    //
    // ⚠️ OVERLAY is now persisted too, as a STABLE STRING — the "Phase D second pass" the note below
    // anticipated, landing with D6's CRT overlay. `overlay_name` (matching Android's SharedPreferences
    // key) survives the shell's overlay list being reordered; the shell resolves the name to an index at
    // boot (shell/overlay.h), and "OFF" is the no-overlay choice. An absent key keeps the default (OFF),
    // which is what an upgrading user's file has until they touch it.
    //
    // ⚠️ LAYOUT (the row's *mode selection*) is STILL deliberately not here. There is no shell-side layout
    // MODE override to resolve a name against — the shell auto-selects portrait/landscape by orientation
    // and fullscreen by controller presence — so Android keeps `layout_mode` in SharedPreferences with no

    // arbitrary eighteen-colour palette that exists nowhere but in this file, and storing its NAME threw
    // away every colour the user had dialled — silently, on every quit, with the app cheerfully coming
    // back up in CLASSIC. Android never had the bug: it serializes the entire AppTheme into
    // SharedPreferences (`prefs["app_theme"]`, MainActivity), which is exactly what this now mirrors.
    //
