// ─── The SETTINGS screen's row geometry ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The ONE table the cursor walks and the module draws, in the shape S4 gave the INSTRUMENT screen
// (ui/instrument_row_layout.h) and for a sharper reason: here, WHICH ROWS EXIST is a function of the
// platform (ui/platform_caps.h), so nothing may re-derive the answer for itself.
//
// ⚠️ A ROW'S NUMBER IS ITS IDENTITY, ON BOTH PLATFORMS. `SettingsRow::KB_INSERT` is 5 whether or not
// rows 0 and 2–4 exist on this device, and the cursor stores THAT — not a compacted "third visible
// row" index. Two things fall out, and both are the point:
//
//   • The Kotlin golden speaks in row numbers, so ptinput can drive the C++ module at row 5 and
//     compare it against Kotlin's row 5 directly. A compacted index would have made every ported
//     row's identity depend on the caps it was recorded under.
//   • The SDL shell and the Android app agree about what a setting IS, which is what makes a shared
//     settings file (and, one day, a shared screen) possible at all.
//
// ⚠️ AND KOTLIN'S ROW SKIP CANNOT BE PORTED LITERALLY. TrackerController hides its two debug rows
// with a single substitution:
//
//     var prev = if (settingsCursorRow > 0) settingsCursorRow - 1 else 12
//     if (!BuildConfig.DEBUG && prev == 12) prev = 11   // TRACE/ENG hidden in release
//     if (!BuildConfig.DEBUG && prev == 2)  prev = 1    // OVERLAY hidden in release
//
// That is a ONE-LEVEL hop, and it is correct on Android only because no two hidden rows are ever
// adjacent there. On the shell, rows 2, 3 and 4 (OVERLAY, BTN SOUND, BTN VIBRO) all vanish TOGETHER
// — so a single substitution off row 1 lands on row 3, which is not there either, and the cursor
// disappears onto a row that is never drawn. The walk below LOOPS, which is the general form of what
// Kotlin was approximating.
