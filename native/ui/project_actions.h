// ─── The PROJECT screen's actions, where they meet the FILESYSTEM ────────────────────────────────
//
// SAVE, EXPORT (mix and stems), and the song TEMPLATE. Split out of the dispatcher because all three
// need two things at once — the host (to serialize, to render) and a FileSystem (to name a file, to
// make a folder) — and because ptdispatch can then drive them over a real temp directory and check
// what actually landed on disk.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THE STEMS POLICY IS SPLIT IN TWO. `songcore::stems_plan` decides WHICH stems a project has
// (pure, no filesystem — songcore has to keep compiling for the Android NDK, where "where do files
// live" is scoped storage and Kotlin's answer). This file decides WHERE they go. Kotlin's
// RenderController holds both halves; it is zone C and dies with the Kotlin sequencer, so the two
// copies are temporary — and the C++ one is the measured one (ptdispatch renders a real stems set
// and counts the files).
