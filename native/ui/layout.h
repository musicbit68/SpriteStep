// ─── The layout ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The frame layout: oscilloscope/header strip, a full-width 620px editor region, and navigation
// furniture. Sequencer matrices deliberately use the full editor width so their shared 37px grid
// can show all sixteen columns.
//
// The geometry is the whole reason this exists as its own file, and it is exact:
//
//     y =  0..  5   6px top spacer
//     y =  6.. 75   oscilloscope        (620 × 70, at x = 10)
//     y = 76.. 81   6px spacer
//     y = 82..473   the editor module   (510 × 392, at x = 10)      ← 6 + 70 + 6 + 392 = 474
//     navigation furniture is retained separately from the full-width sequencer editor.
//
// Editors are clipped to the left of the right bar so a full-width row highlight cannot bleed into
// the BPM readout — Compose spells that `clipRect(right = …)`, and the number is derived below rather
// than written down, exactly as the Kotlin does.
//
// ⚠️ The clip is NOT cosmetic and the module widths do not make it redundant: an editor is 510px wide
// at x=10, so its row backgrounds run to x=520 — 11px INTO the right bar's column. The clip at 509 is
// what cuts them. (S1 had the nav map at 80px wide instead of 115, which put the clip at 544 and so
// clipped nothing at all; the row highlights ran under the BPM row. The width below is the Kotlin's.)

     * clever, so it asks the modules that own the state rather than modelling the fall itself.
