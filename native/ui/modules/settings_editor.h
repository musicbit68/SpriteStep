// ─── SETTINGS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The C++ twin of ui/modules/SettingsModule.kt — and the first screen in the port where the two
// platforms genuinely differ. Which rows exist is a function of PlatformCaps (ui/platform_caps.h);
// where they sit is ui/settings_row_layout.h. Neither answer is re-derived here.
//
// ⚠️ THE MODULE EDITS INDICES AND FLAGS. IT DOES NOT KNOW WHAT A LAYOUT MODE IS.
//
// That is the line that keeps Android's device rows portable without dragging Android into the port.
// LAYOUT is "an enum cycle over `layoutCount` options, currently at `layoutIndex`"; OVERLAY is the
// same plus a hex byte; BTN SOUND is a toggle plus a hex byte. What an index MEANS — FULLSCREEN vs
// PORTRAIT, which .png, how loud a click is — is the platform's business, and it stays there. So
// `DeviceAdapter.LayoutMode` is NOT ported (it would be dead code in a UI that can never use it),
// and yet the LAYOUT row's cursor context and edit semantics still are — which is exactly what lets
// `ptinput` golden all thirteen rows against Kotlin under `PlatformCaps::android()`, including the
// ones the shell will never draw.
//
// The display STRINGS for those rows (the layout's name, the overlay file, the skin) are handed in
// as text the module merely paints. On the shell they are empty, and the rows are not drawn at all.
//
// ⚠️ SINGLE A IS RESERVED FOR ACTIONS. Every value row changes with A+DPAD; plain A does something
// only on THEME (opens the editor) and TEMPLATE (SAVE / CLEAR). Kotlin states this in a comment at
// the top of its class and enforces it by giving every other row an editable context; the port does
// the same, and the dispatcher's A arm therefore has exactly two cases.

    // above already follow, and MIDI is the case that rule was WRITTEN for: a port list is rebuilt from

    // read at boot and it OPENS THE PORT (`InputDispatcher::boot_midi_in_port`), which is what makes the
    // desk loopback survive a restart; what E3 adds is a way to change it without editing settings.json.
