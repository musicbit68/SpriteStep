// ─── The THEME EDITOR ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The 1:1 twin of `ui/modules/ThemeEditorModule.kt`, and the last screen in the Kotlin dispatcher the
// port had not reached. Twenty rows: the THEME row on top (the built-in cycle, SAVE, LOAD) and the
// nineteen colours under it, each an R/G/B triple with a live swatch. The list is taller than the
// panel, so it scrolls — the same idea as SONG and the file browser.
//
// ⚠️ IT HAS NO CursorContext, AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT. Kotlin's `handleGenericInput` opens with
// `if (themeEditorState.isOpen) return` — the whole cursor-context system is bypassed, and the four
// A+DPAD handlers call `adjustThemeColor` directly. It is the third screen in the app to work that way
// (the file browser has no context either, and the sample editor's waveform rows have none), and for
// the same reason all three do: a value here is a CHANNEL OF A COLOUR, not a cell of a document, and
// nothing in `CursorContext`'s vocabulary can say that.
//
// So the edit lives in the two free functions below rather than in a `handle_input` override. They are
// pure — a `Theme` in, a `Theme` out, no engine, no project, no canvas — which is what lets `ptinput`
// byte-compare them against the real Kotlin `adjustThemeColor` and `cycle*BuiltinTheme` directly,
// instead of a copy of their arithmetic living in the test. (S6a's lesson, one layer up: a fixture that
// re-derives the thing it is measuring cannot catch the thing it is measuring.)

 * Nudge one channel of the colour under the cursor. Kotlin's `AppInputDispatcher.adjustThemeColor`.
 *
 * `row` is the CURSOR row (1..17); row 0 is the THEME header and is rejected, as Kotlin rejects it.
 * `delta` is ±0x01 from A+RIGHT / A+LEFT and ±0x10 from A+UP / A+DOWN.
 *
 * ⚠️ Each channel CLAMPS at 0 and 255 — it does not wrap. Rolling 0xFF over to 0x00 would take a
 * colour you are dialling UP and drop it to black, which is not a nudge, it is a cliff.
 *
 * ⚠️ And the alpha is FORCED to 0xFF on every write (`0xFF000000L or …`), not preserved. A theme colour
 * is opaque by construction; there is no alpha channel in the editor and no row to reach one from, so a
 * `.ptt` hand-edited to carry a translucent colour is made opaque again by the first nudge. Kotlin's,
 * reproduced.

    // and nothing else calls this), and it is mirrored anyway so the golden can sweep an out-of-range

/**
 * Step the built-in palette. `delta` is −1 (A+LEFT, Kotlin's `cyclePrevBuiltinTheme`) or +1 (A+RIGHT,
 * `cycleNextBuiltinTheme`).
 *
 * ⚠️ IT REPLACES THE WHOLE THEME, so every colour the user has dialled on the current one is GONE. That
 * is Kotlin's — the cycle is how you pick a starting palette, and SAVE is how you keep one you have
 * changed. Reproduced without a guard, because adding a "you have unsaved changes" dialog here would be
 * a behaviour the phone does not have.
 *
 * ⚠️ The two directions are NOT exact inverses, and that falls out of Kotlin's two expressions rather
 * than being designed:
 *
 *     next = if (idx >= 0) (idx + 1) % size else 0        // an unknown name → CLASSIC
 *     prev = if (idx > 0)  idx - 1        else size - 1   // an unknown name → MONO
 *
 * `idx` is the index of the CURRENT theme's NAME among the built-ins, so a palette loaded from a `.ptt`
 * (or any edited-and-renamed one) is not in the list at all — it is −1. Stepping DOWN from it lands on
 * CLASSIC and stepping UP lands on MONO: both "enter the ring at an end", which is sane, and neither
 * takes you back where you came from, which is the honest consequence of the theme having left the ring
 * the moment it stopped being a built-in. Ported as written.
 *
 * `visualizerType` rides across the swap — the palette belongs to the theme, the visualizer to the user.
