// ─── MIDI ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The screen the MIDI plan's §8.1 asks for, and the increment (B4.3) that finally makes the EXTERNAL
// bus reachable without an environment variable. B4.1 gave the instrument a TYPE, B4.2 gave it a patch
// page — but the CABLE was still picked by `SPRITESTEP_MIDI_OUT`, which means the feature shipped in
// a state where nobody could reach it. This is the row that ends that.
//
// It has NO Kotlin twin and never will: MIDI out did not exist before the port. So — like `ptmidi` and
// unlike every other module here — there is no golden to compare against and no "does it still match
// Kotlin" question to ask. What can be checked is the same thing `ptdispatch` checks everywhere else:
// that the cursor reaches every row, that each row's context is the one its value needs, and that a
// press changes what it claims to change.
//
// ── ⚠️ WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT OWN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// **It never opens, closes or writes to a port.** It edits an index into a list of names it was HANDED,
// and the dispatcher — the only place that can reach `songcore::IMidiOut` — turns a changed index into
// `close()` + `open()`. That is `settings_editor.h`'s rule ("the module edits indices and flags; it
// does not know what a layout mode is") applied to the one seam where getting it wrong would be worse
// than untidy: enumerating devices means asking the OS, and pt-ui is the layer with no OS in it.
//
// It is also why OUTPUT's displayed value is `deviceNames[deviceIndex]` and not the setting string.
// ⭐ **The row shows what is OPEN, not what was WANTED.** A saved device that is not plugged in today
// resolves to index 0 and the row reads OFF — which is the truth, where painting the remembered name
// would be a screen quietly lying about whether a cable exists.

     * separate enumerators for that reason, and this is the same fact reaching the screen.

     * rebuilt on every frame the screen is up AND on every button press, so a by-value list is two
     * vector allocations plus one per port name, at 60 Hz, for data the module only reads.
