// ─── THE SAMPLE EDITOR ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The C++ twin of ui/modules/SampleEditorModule.kt — the biggest single module in the app, and the
// last screen that is neither the arrangement nor the filesystem. It is where a sample stops being a
// file and becomes an instrument: trim it, slice it, normalise it, pitch it to the grid, chop it into
// a folder of one-shots.
//
// ── IT PORTS NO DSP, AND THAT IS THE POINT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every one of the twelve operations already exists, in C++, in the engine (`native/sample-editor.cpp`
// + `native/transient-detector.cpp`), because Android's JNI layer is a thin forward and always was.
// crop, copy, cut, dupl, paste, del / norm, fade+, fade−, silence, reverse, undo — plus the FX row,
// the pitch shift, the time stretch and the transient detector. **Not one line of signal processing is
// written this session.** What was missing was never the DSP: it was the module that draws the
// waveform, the cursor that walks it, and the dispatcher arm that turns a button into one of those
// calls. That is what lands here.
//
// ── FULL-SCREEN, like the file browser ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 640×480 with no oscilloscope strip and no right bar (`SampleEditorModule.height = 480`). A waveform
// needs the width, and the note monitor has nothing to say about a sample that is not playing.
//
// ── THE ROW MAP IS SPARSE, and the gaps are the layout ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The cursor does not walk 0..19. It walks 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 — rows 3–7 are the
// WAVEFORM (which the cursor enters as a unit, not as five rows), and 9/12/15/17 are spacers that
// exist only to give the sections air. Which is why `row_above`/`row_below` are a lookup table rather
// than `row ± 1`, and why they take the SLICE METHOD: with slicing OFF, row 11 (the slice detail) is
// not drawn and must not be reachable, so DOWN from 10 skips straight to 13.
//
// ⚠️ **Rows 3..8 are the SELECTION, and their D-pad does not move the cursor — it drags an edge.**
// A+UP/DOWN nudges the selection edge coarsely (±totalFrames/16), A+LEFT/RIGHT finely (±/256), both
// scaled by the zoom and snapped to a zero crossing (`snapEnabled`). That is why `cursor_context()`
// answers `none()` for the whole range: there is no cell there to increment. The dispatcher handles it.
