// ─── FILE BROWSER ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The C++ twin of ui/modules/FileBrowserModule.kt. A full-screen (640×480) list that covers the whole
// layout — the top strip and the right bar go away, which is why it is drawn by `TrackerLayout` as a
// special case rather than as a module inside the editor pane.
//
// It is a NAVIGATOR, not an editor: it has no cursor context, no `handle_input`, and it writes nothing
// into the project. What it owns is a listing, a cursor over it, a sort order, a multi-select and a
// file clipboard — and the answer to "which file did the user pick", which the dispatcher then does
// something with depending on WHY the browser was opened (ui/browser_purpose.h).
//
// ── ⚠️ Two modes are NOT ported, because nothing on Android can reach them ────────────────────────
//
// `BrowserMode` has four values in Kotlin — NORMAL, DELETE, RENAME, CREATE — and **nothing anywhere
// assigns RENAME or CREATE**. They are the remains of an in-place text editor that the QWERTY keyboard
// overlay replaced and that was never removed: SELECT+A opens the keyboard with
// `QwertyContext.FILE_RENAME` and SELECT+R with `FOLDER_CREATE` (AppInputDispatcher:2907/2936), and
// the two enum values are dead. Behind them, so is everything that serves them — `renameBuffer` and
// `renameCursor`, two branches of the draw, the D-pad's LEFT/RIGHT arms in the dispatcher, and BOTH
// arms of `getCursorContext` (the NORMAL/DELETE arm returns a `browserLine` context that is only ever
// *read* from the RENAME/CREATE-gated branch, so it is dead by association). `CursorContextFactory
// .browserLine` has no live caller in the app at all.
//
// So this port has NORMAL and DELETE, and the browser has no cursor context. That is not a
// simplification of Kotlin's behaviour — it is all of Kotlin's REACHABLE behaviour, and porting the
// rest would have been porting a second text editor that no button opens.
