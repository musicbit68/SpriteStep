// ─── OSCILLOSCOPE / VISUALIZER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The C++ twin of ui/modules/OscilloscopeModule.kt: the 620×70 strip across the top, in six modes
// (SCOPE / FLAT / OCTA / OCTA_FULL / SPECTRUM / SPECTRUM_PEAKS) chosen by the theme.
//
// THE ONLY STATEFUL MODULE IN THE UI, and the reason `TrackerLayout::draw` is not const. The peak-hold
// dots and the spectrum bars' decay are functions of the PREVIOUS frame, not of the audio — so the
// module instance lives in the layout and persists across frames, exactly as Kotlin's does (it holds
// three FloatArrays for the same reason). A module recreated per frame would show bars that never fall.
//
// It reads no engine. The samples arrive as plain pointers that the caller has already captured
// (ui/engine_feed.h does that on the SDL side; Kotlin's PixelPerfectRenderer does it in its 60 Hz
// loop). A null pointer is silence, not a crash — which is precisely how `tools/ptshot` draws a screen
// with no audio device in the process.

     * At rest is the resting state, not a transient: a bar under one LED cell is snapped to zero rather
     * than left to an exponential that never arrives, so the frame that brings the last one down is also
     * the frame that shows it gone.

     * ⚠️ Answers only for the two SPECTRUM modes. The other four never call `draw_bar_amps`, so this
     * state is whatever the last spectrum theme left in it — the caller gates on the visualizer type
     * (layout.cpp), the way it gates the mixer's markers on the MIXER being up.
