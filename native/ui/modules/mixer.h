// ─── MIXER ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The C++ twin of ui/modules/MixerModule.kt. Eight stereo track meters, a master meter, the two send
// returns (REV / DEL), and the master strip: MIX volume, EQ slot, OTT/DUST depth, LIM pre-gain.
//
// ⚠️ THE SECOND STATEFUL MODULE IN THE UI, after the oscilloscope — and for the same reason: the
// peak-hold markers are a function of the PREVIOUS frame, not of the project. Its `draw` is therefore
// non-const, and `TrackerLayout` holds it by value like the scope.
//
// ⚠️ **The peak-hold advances on NEW DATA, not on a frame.** `PEAK_HOLD_FRAMES = 45` counts *draws*
// in Kotlin — where a draw is a Compose recomposition, and the only thing that triggers one on this
// screen is the peak poll's `stateVersion++` every 60 ms. So 45 "frames" is ~2.7 seconds of hang. The
// SDL shell redraws at 60 Hz, so counting its draws would expire the hold in 0.75 s and make the
// meters fall visibly faster than Android's. `peaksVersion` is what closes that gap: the feed bumps it
// once per 60 ms poll (ui/engine_feed.h), and the hold only steps when it moves. Same constants, same
// wall-clock behaviour, on both platforms — see the note on `steps` in the .cpp.
//
// ⚠️ It steps as far as the version MOVED, not once per draw that finds it moved. The feed bumps it by
// every 60 ms slot that went by, including slots spent on another screen where neither this draw nor
// that poll was running, so a marker caught mid-fall resumes at the clock's position rather than the
// one it was parked at.
//
// The CURSOR here is (mixerMasterRow, cursorColumn) and it is not a grid — see ui/cursor_move.h:
//   row 0: cols 0..7 = track volumes, col 8 = master MIX
//   row 1: col 0 = REV wet, col 1 = DEL wet, col 8 = master EQ slot
//   row 2: col 8 = OTT/DUST depth   (which of the two is a function of masterBusFx)
//   row 3: col 8 = LIM pre-gain
// Rows 2 and 3 exist ONLY in column 8. Every other (row, column) pair is unreachable by navigation,
// and `cursor_context` answers `none()` there — which is what makes the unreachable states harmless.
