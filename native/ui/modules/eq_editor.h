// ─── THE EQ EDITOR ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The C++ twin of ui/modules/EqModule.kt + ui/overlays/EqEditorOverlay.kt: three parametric bands, a
// live spectrum, and the response curve they add up to.
//
// ── It is an OVERLAY, not a screen, and that is not a technicality ───────────────────────────────
//
// It has no cell in the 5×5 navigation grid and `currentScreen` does not change when it opens. It is
// raised from a CELL — the EQ slot on INSTRUMENT, on INST.POOL, on MIXER's master strip, on either of
// EFFECTS' two input rows, and on the SAMPLE EDITOR's FX row — and every one of those cells has spent
// seven sessions dialling a slot NUMBER with nothing behind it. `EqCallerContext` is what remembers
// which cell asked, because B+LEFT/RIGHT cycles the slot from inside the editor and that has to write
// back into the caller's own field: `masterEqSlot`, `reverbInputEq`, `delayInputEq`, an instrument's
// `eqSlot`, or the sample editor's `fxValue`. Five different fields, one gesture.
//
// ⚠️ The caller is captured AT OPEN TIME and never re-read. That is deliberate and it is what makes
// the editor safe to leave open: the pool cursor moving underneath it must not silently re-point the
// bands at a different instrument. (Android lets that cursor move — see the B+UP note in
// input_dispatcher.cpp — which is the bug this session found.)
//
// ── Its geometry is its own ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 495 × 392 at the normal module position, so the oscilloscope strip and the right-hand bar stay
// drawn around it. Not full-screen like the browser and the sample editor: an EQ is something you dial
// WHILE a note rings, and the note monitor is how you see that it is still ringing.
//
//     y =   0.. 20   header — "EQ 07" and who opened it
//     y =  21.. 41   one blank row (the module's own top spacer)
//     y =  42..261   the visualization: spectrum fill + spectrum curve + the yellow response curve
//     y = 263..      the editor: a label column and three band columns, four param rows each
//
// ── The cursor is ONE int over a 3×4 grid ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `cursorRow` is 0..11; band = row / 4 (the COLUMN on screen) and param = row % 4 (the ROW). So UP and
// DOWN walk the four params of one band, and LEFT and RIGHT change band while keeping the param — which
// is what lets you sweep the same parameter across all three bands without moving your thumb. Both
// CLAMP; neither wraps.
