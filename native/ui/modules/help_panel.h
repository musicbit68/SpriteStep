// ─── THE HELP PANEL — the compact one ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three lines about the cell under the cursor, drawn IN PLACE OF whatever 620-wide box the screen can
// spare: the visualizer strip on the fourteen screens that have one, and the WAVEFORM panel on the
// sample editor, which has no strip. The mascot sits at the left, the text to its right.
//
// ⚠️ **IT REPLACES ITS BOX RATHER THAN COVERING IT**, and on the strip the two readouts that share it
// — the global status message top-left, and the selection/clipboard readout top-right — stand down
// while it is up (`layout.cpp`). Three lines of 21px fill the strip exactly; there is no corner left
// for either of them.
//
// ⚠️ **THE WIDTH IS THE SAME 620 IN BOTH BOXES, AND THAT IS WHY THERE IS ONE TABLE.** `HELP_MAX_CHARS`
// is derived from the width alone, so the sample editor costs no second budget and no second set of
// lines. Only the HEIGHT differs — 70 on the strip, 155 in the waveform — and the extra 85px is spent
// as air above and below rather than on more text: a fourth line would exist on one screen only.
//
// ⚠️ **THREE COLOURS AND NO MORE: VIZ BG behind, VIZ WAVE for the text, TXT TITLE for the mascot.**
// The first two are the strip's own theme keys, so the panel re-themes itself with the visualizer it
// stands in for, and a palette that made the scope readable makes this readable too. The waveform
// panel's ground is VIZ BG as well, so the pair lands there unchanged — the wave's own TXT VALUE /
// TXT EMPTY are not borrowed, because the guarantee that the text is legible belongs to the viz pair.
// The mascot takes the header colour instead, so it reads as a figure rather than as more text; it is
// one bit deep for exactly that reason — see ui/mascot_sprite.h.
//
// The FULL overlay is a separate screen and not this file. ⚠️ One screen can never show this one:
// FILE_BROWSER is 640×480 of file rows with no box to spare, and SELECT is its rename/delete chord.
