// ─── The UI state ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything the screens draw from that is NOT the project itself: where the cursor is, which screen
// is up, which phrase/chain/instrument is being looked at, and the playhead the 60 Hz loop last read
// out of songcore.
//
// On Android this state is scattered across `TrackerController` and ~60 `mutableStateOf` refs in
// MainActivity, and it has to be: Compose needs observable holders to know what to recompose. There
// is no recomposition here — the frame is redrawn from this struct — so the observers collapse into
// plain fields and the two halves become one struct. The FIELD NAMES are kept, because the Kotlin
// files are the executable spec for the port and a reviewer must be able to read them side by side.
//
// ⚠️ EVERYTHING A FRAME READS IS IN HERE, and that is the design rather than an accident of size: the
// draw path takes this struct and nothing else, so a field that is not here cannot reach the screen.
// A new screen adds its fields here; it does not get state of its own.
