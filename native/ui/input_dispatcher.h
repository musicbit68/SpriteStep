// ─── THE INPUT DISPATCHER ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The C++ twin of input/AppInputDispatcher.kt — every button, every combo, one place. It replaces
// the `handle_button` stand-in the Phase-3 S1/S2 shell carried, and keeps everything that was under
// it: `cursor_context()` still answers what the cursor is on, and the generic `on_a` / `on_b` /
// `on_a_left` / `on_a_right` / `on_a_b` handlers still turn a button into an `InputAction` without
// ever asking which screen is up (ui/cursor.h). What lands here is what those five could not do —
// selection, the clipboard, item cycling, cloning, the FX helper, the note preview.
//
// ── SCOPE: every screen the app has ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// SONG, CHAIN, PHRASE, TABLE, GROOVE, INSTRUMENT, INST.POOL, MODS, MIXER, EFFECTS, the FILE BROWSER
// with the QWERTY KEYBOARD overlay behind it, the SAMPLE EDITOR, PROJECT and SETTINGS with the confirm
// dialog, the EQ EDITOR overlay behind all five EQ cells, the MIDI screen, and the THEME editor.
// Every screen the app has is dispatched from here; there is no second input path.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE MODAL RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The CONFIRM DIALOG is the topmost layer, the QWERTY keyboard is a true modal, the THEME and EQ
// editors are PARTIAL ones, the FX HELPER is a picker held up by A, and the FILE BROWSER is a
// full-screen popup. Each OWNS THE BUTTONS while it is up, and the order in which a press is offered
// to them is the specification, not an implementation detail: the keyboard can be open ON TOP of the
// browser (SELECT+A to rename a file) or ON TOP of the theme editor (its SAVE), and a D-pad press
// there must move the KEY cursor, not the one underneath.
//
// ⭐ **That order is written exactly once, in `top_overlay()`**, and every handler below asks
// `overlay_swallows()` with the set of layers it answers for rather than re-deriving the stack. See
// the block comment on those two, which is where the rule's whole mechanism now lives.
//
// ⚠️ **The EQ editor is PARTIAL, and that is a design decision rather than an oversight.** It swallows
// the D-pad, A, B and SELECT, but it lets START through to the screen underneath — because START on
// INSTRUMENT is an AUDITION, and sweeping a band across a note you can hear is the entire reason the
// screen exists. Kotlin is explicit about it (`stopActivePreview` counts the EQ editor as a preview
// screen when it was opened over an instrument, so its band edits "sweep a held preview live").
// Every other modal in the app swallows everything.
//
// ⚠️ **A modal that one handler forgets is a button that does the wrong thing exactly once** — and
// that is a bug nobody reports, because it looks like a mis-press. Android carries a live one, found
// by porting: `handleBUp`/`handleBDown` never got the EQ guard, so B+UP with the editor open over
// INST.POOL pages the pool cursor 16 slots underneath it. See on_b_up(). That is the failure a
// per-handler subset invites and the reason the stack is derived here rather than remembered.
//
// ── THE MAPPER IS SPLIT IN TWO, AND ONLY ONE HALF IS THE SHELL'S ─────────────────────────────────
//
// Android's chain is InputMapper → ButtonHandlers → AppInputDispatcher: the mapper owns the physical
// keys, the held-modifier state and the key repeat, and calls a NAMED handler. The split is kept —
// the methods below are the ButtonHandlers — but Kotlin's one `InputMapper` class answers to TWO
// files here, and the boundary between them is the only platform seam in the input chain:
//
//   • `shell/sdl-input.h`  — a keycode, a game-controller button, an axis, the key repeat. SDL's.
//   • `ui/button_mapper.h` — the COMBO MATRIX: which named handler a press means. Portable.
//
// ⚠️ **This header used to say there is no `handle(ButtonEvent)` here because "pt-ui must not know
// SDL exists (a `ButtonEvent` is an SDL-side type)". The rule is right and the parenthesis was
// wrong** — `ButtonEvent` never named an SDL type, it was merely DECLARED in a header that included
// `<SDL.h>`, and convergence C0.1 moved it to `ui/buttons.h` where that accident cannot be mistaken
// for a design again. The cost of the mistake was real: it kept the combo matrix in `shell/main.cpp`,
// in one copy, where no tool could reach it (`tools/ptmapper` covers it now).
//
// There is still no `handle(ButtonEvent)` on this class, and that part stands on its own feet: the
// matrix is a free function so a headless tool can drive it with a recording stub, and keeping the
// dispatcher's surface at NAMED handlers is what lets ptdispatch drive them one at a time.
//
// ⚠️ **The clock is injected.** `set_now()` once a frame, and `on_l_b()` reads it. The multi-tap
// window is a function of time, and a class that reaches for the clock itself cannot be tested —
// the same reason `SdlInput::handle_event` takes `now_ms` (S1) and `Selection::handle_select_b`
// does (ui/selection.h).

     *
     * ⚠️ Which means the clock is INJECTED rather than read, and that is the point: work that fires on
