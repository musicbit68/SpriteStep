// ─── The engine feed ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything the UI reads back OUT of the audio engine, once per frame: the oscilloscope's samples,
// the note monitor's eight notes, and the TABLE screen's playing row.
//
// On Android this is the body of PixelPerfectRenderer's two `LaunchedEffect` loops — it lives there
// because Compose needs the values in observable state before a recomposition can see them. There is
// no recomposition here, so the same reads collapse into one call the shell makes per frame, and the
// modules keep taking plain pointers.
//
// WHY IT IS UI CODE AND NOT SHELL CODE. Nothing in it is SDL, a window, or Linux — it is the *policy*
// of which buffers a given visualizer mode needs, and that policy belongs to the visualizer. Put it in
// the shell and the next shell (Android-on-SDL, per §12.8) reinvents it, differently.
//
// It is also the ONE place in `pt-ui` that includes the engine. The modules must not: a module that
// reached for `AudioEngine` could not be drawn by `tools/ptshot`, which has no engine at all — and
// ptshot's ability to draw every screen headlessly is the standing proof that the UI is portable. So
// the feed is what any *shell* constructs, and a tool simply does not construct one.

     * ⚠️ **The SOURCE depends on WHO OPENED THE EDITOR**, and that is the whole point of the call. An EQ
     * on the reverb send filters the reverb's INPUT; an instrument's EQ filters that instrument's voices;
     * the master EQ filters the master bus. Draw any of them over the master spectrum — which is what the
     * visualizer's own `spectrum` field holds — and the curve would sit on top of a signal the band is

     * EQ editor replaces the module but not the furniture, so both spectra are on screen together,
     * reading the same ring through the same transform. Anything slower than the visualizer's own
     * cadence shows the same audio at two different ages, side by side, and reads as lag.
     *
     * An FFT is not free, but the cost went the other way: the window and the bin map are constants
     * that `computeSpectrumFFT` used to rebuild per call, and caching them halved a poll. Per frame
     * here now costs about 1.5x what every-50-ms used to, and the visualizer — which already polled
     * per frame — got the same halving, so with a spectrum visualizer up the pair is cheaper than
     * before.
     *
     * ⚠️ **The one case that got dearer is an OPEN EQ SCREEN OVER SILENCE.** The main loop stops
     * DRAWING when nothing is audible but never stops POLLING, so this runs at frame rate with
     * nothing to show. It is bounded and small — one poll, no audio-thread work, since the engine's
     * capture gate keys on reads being recent rather than frequent — but it is the term to look at
     * first if the handheld ever reads warm on this screen.
     *
     * The buffer is a member, not a local: `AppState::eqSpectrum` is a POINTER the module reads during
     * the draw, so what it points at has to outlive this call.
