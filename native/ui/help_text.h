// ─── HELP ON SELECT — the text, and what the cursor is standing on ───────────────────────────────
//
// Tap SELECT and the visualizer strip becomes three lines explaining the cell under the cursor. This
// header is the whole of the WRITING half: a topic for every explainable place in the app, the three
// lines each one shows, and the lookup that turns a cursor position into a topic.
//
// It is PURE — no canvas, no theme, no drawing. That split is `fx_helper.h`'s, and for the same
// reason: the text can be checked, and the lookup driven, without linking a renderer.
//
// ── THE FOUR RULES THE TEXT OBEYS, AND WHY TWO OF THEM ARE COMPILER-CHECKED ──────────────────────
//
//  1. **Three lines, and the first one NAMES the thing** — "VOL: how loud this step is". The name is
//     what the reader is hunting for; the two lines under it are what it does.
//  2. ⚠️ **HELP_MAX_CHARS per line.** The strip is 620px wide, the mascot takes 64 of them plus its
//     margins, and a glyph advances CHAR_W. A longer line runs off the right edge, silently.
//  3. ⚠️ **NO APOSTROPHE AND NO SEMICOLON.** `font5x5.h` has neither glyph and draws a BLANK, so
//     "the sample's pitch" comes out as "THE SAMPLE S PITCH". The string is right, the width is
//     right, only the pixels are wrong. Stick to letters, digits, and `: = - ( ) . / , +` — plus
//     the four arrows ← ↑ → ↓, the one thing above ASCII the font maps, each costing ONE column.
//  4. Say what the cell DOES, not why it is shaped that way.
//
// Rules 2 and 3 are a `static_assert` over the whole table below (`help_table_ok`), so a line that
// breaks either one fails the BUILD rather than reaching a device. Rules 1 and 4 need a reader.
//
// ⚠️ **A CELL WITH NO ENTRY FALLS BACK TO ITS SCREEN.** `help_topic` returns a SCREEN_* topic for
// anything not written up yet, so a half-finished table still says something useful everywhere — and
// a new screen is never silent by omission.
//
// ⚠️ Nothing here is persisted, so the enum's order is free — but it is APPENDED to anyway, because
// HELP_ENTRIES is indexed by the enum value and an insert would silently re-point every entry below.

 * when there is no body), then the CONTROLS in the closing hint's colour. The compact panel reads only
 * the three summary lines.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE BODY REPLACES `line2`/`line3` IN THE FULL OVERLAY, IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THEM.** A summary is
 * often a gesture squeezed into two lines ("A+←/→ steps a semitone"), and the same gesture is then in
 * the controls — shown twice, it reads as a mistake.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Both lists are optional, and a null line ends nothing — it is a blank row.** A topic with neither
 * shows its summary alone, which is what lets them be written a topic at a time.
 *
 * Both obey the summary's two compiler-checked rules, at the same HELP_MAX_CHARS — the overlay has room
 * for 35, and one budget for every line is worth more than three characters.
