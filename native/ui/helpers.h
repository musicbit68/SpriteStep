// A 1:1 port of ui/EditorHelpers.kt: the layout constants every screen is built on, the row
// background priority, and the two cell painters (a grid cell, an EQ cell) that the editors share so
// they cannot drift apart from each other.
//
// The hex formatters and the effect names are NOT re-implemented here — songcore already carries
// them (`songcore::hex2`, `effect_name`, `effect_value_max`, `note_name`), because they are the
// data model's own vocabulary and the sequencer speaks it too. Kotlin has the same arrangement:
// `EditorHelpers.getEffectTypeName()` is a one-line alias for `EffectProcessor.effectName()`, "so the
// code↔name map lives in core and can't drift from the effect codes".

//
//   * `cursor_cell_ink` — text that sits INSIDE the cursor's bar. The bar is `rowCursor`, so the ink
//     is `background`: the cell inverts, which is what makes a cursor readable at a glance on a grid
//     of identical cells.
//   * `cursor_mark_ink` — text that says WHICH row or column the cursor is in, with no bar behind it.
//     A row number, a column heading, the label of the row the cursor is on. `rowCursor` itself, on
//     the plain ground — the same colour as the bar, so one accent says "you are here" everywhere.
//
// ⚠️ NEITHER IS A ROW OF THE THEME EDITOR, and that is the point. They used to be one row (TXT CURSOR)
// which could be set to anything, including a colour invisible on its own bar. Reading them off the
// ground beside them means the pair cannot disagree — and it leaves `rowCursor` as the single accent a
// palette dials to move every cursor in the app at once.

 *
 * ⚠️ THE COLOUR IS `textPlayhead` AS TYPED. The lift that makes an old theme's ROW PLAY readable as

//
// ⚠️ A CURSOR IS `rowCursor` BEHIND AND `background` IN FRONT, EVERYWHERE — `cursor_cell_ink` above,
// and a cell that wants to stand out uses the pair rather than mixing a shade of its own. A shade
// mixed out of the accent looks like a reasonable highlight and reads as one, but it answers to no row
// of the theme editor: a user who sets ROW CURSOR sees every grid in the app change and that one cell
// not. It is the same trap `eqFill` was in (theme.h) — a colour with no key of its own.

/**
 * A grid row's cells, painted left to right, with the standard colour priority per cell:
 * cursor > selection > empty > `value_color` (which varies per column: values, params, FX names).
 *
 * ⚠️ BOTH THE CURSOR'S BACKGROUND AND THE SELECTION'S ARE PAINTED HERE, per cell — `row_bg_color`
 * has neither.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE SELECTION OUTRANKS THE CURSOR IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE LOSING TO IT IN THE TEXT. That is
 * not a contradiction: the cursor is always inside the selection it is dragging, so a cursor
 * background would punch a hole in the one region the screen is trying to show as a block. The
 * region stays one unbroken colour and the cursor says where its edge is with its INK alone. ⚠️ WHICH
 * IS WHY THE TWO INKS ARE A SHADE APART RATHER THAN OPPOSITES: inside a selection the cursor's cell is
 * the one cell reading `background` where its neighbours read `rowEvery4th`, and that difference has
 * to be visible without breaking the block up.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND A SELECTION IS ONE BLOCK, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS AN OBJECT AND NOT A FREE FUNCTION. The
 * gutter between two columns belongs to neither cell, and its width is not something a call site
 * could pass: it is the DISTANCE between two cells, and only something that has already drawn the
 * left one knows it. So a row hands its cells over in COLUMN ORDER and each selected cell whose
 * left neighbour was also selected begins its fill at that neighbour's right edge — a selected
 * range reads as a rectangle rather than as a line of separate chips, and it still stops at the
 * columns the selection actually covers. ⚠️ HANDED OVER OUT OF ORDER, the fill either runs backwards
 * over a cell already drawn or leaves the gap it was meant to close; every grid draws left to right.
 *
 * The width is DERIVED from the text rather than passed in, and that is exact rather than
 * approximate: every column of every grid is fixed-width in GLYPHS, because an empty cell prints a
 * placeholder the same length as a full one (`--`, `---`). So the derived width is uniform down a
 * column without a tenth argument at two dozen call sites, and it is the width of the string
 * actually drawn. ⚠️ A column whose text could change length would highlight raggedly — that is the
 * constraint this buys the brevity with, and it is the one thing to check before adding one.
 *
 * The horizontal margin is CHAR_SPACING, the font's own inter-glyph gap: the cell edge lands exactly
 * where the next character would have begun, which reads as one character cell and clears the
 * playhead marker sitting one CHAR_W to the left of the cell.
