// ─── The file system, as an interface ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The C++ twin of core/storage/IFileSystem.kt, and the reason it is an INTERFACE rather than a set of
// free functions is the same reason Kotlin's is: *where the app's directories live* is the one thing
// about files that is genuinely per-platform. Android resolves them under
// `Documents/SPRITESTEP/…` through `Environment` + scoped storage; a handheld running PortMaster
// has neither, and puts them beside the binary or under `$XDG_DATA_HOME`. Everything ELSE about files
// — list, sort, rename, delete, move — is identical everywhere, and `StdFileSystem` (std_filesystem.h)
// implements the lot in portable C++17.
//
// ⚠️ `pt-ui` still has no POSIX in it. <filesystem> is the C++ standard library, not a platform API:
// it compiles on MSVC, on gcc/libstdc++ and on clang/libc++ from the same source, which is exactly the
// property that lets `tools/ptshot` and `tools/ptinput` link this and run headless on all three CI
// runners. Reaching for <dirent.h> and stat(2) would have been the platform dependency the port plan
// forbids — and would not even have built on the Windows box the port is written on.
//
// ── The interface is SMALLER than Kotlin's, deliberately ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `IFileSystem` has three members with no live caller, and they are not ported:
//   • `sortFiles(files, mode)` — the browser never calls it; it sorts BrowserItems through its own
//     `sort_items` (which keeps ".." pinned and folders above files, neither of which this could do).
//     Two sorts with different rules, one of them dead, is how they drift.
//   • `hasStoragePermission()` — an Android runtime-permission question. A handheld has no such thing;
//     a directory it cannot read reports itself when the listing comes back empty.
//   • `getTemplateProjectPath()` / `getAutosaveFilePath()` — these land with the PROJECT screen, which
//     is what has the NEW / autosave-recovery flows behind it.

/**
 * One directory entry. The C++ twin of `core/storage/FileInfo`, plus two fields Kotlin does not have:
 * `size` and `lastModified` are carried as DATA here, not re-read from the disk on demand.
 *
 * ⚠️ That is not a gratuitous difference — it is the fix for a real cost. Kotlin's `sortItems` sorts by
 * `it.file.lastModified()` and `it.file.length()`, which are `stat(2)` calls made *inside the
 * comparator*: an N-entry directory therefore costs O(N log N) syscalls to sort, and the browser
 * re-sorts on every R+UP. (The Kotlin module already learned half this lesson — `FileItem` caches
 * `sizeText`/`dateText` at build time because formatting them in the 60 fps draw pass "meant ~2.3k
 * syscalls/s" — but the sort kept its own.) The keys are read ONCE, when the entry is built, and the
 * ORDER is identical; only the syscall count differs.
