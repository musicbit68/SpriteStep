// ─── THE CRASH-RECOVERY AUTOSAVE — the file verbs (Phase 3 S10) ───────────────────────────────────
//
// The C++ twin of `FileController`'s autosave block (`hasAutosave` / `writeAutosave` / `loadAutosave`
// / `clearAutosave`) — four functions over a path that nothing else in the app may look at.
//
// ── WHAT THE FILE MEANS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠️ **Its PRESENCE is the whole signal.** It is written while there is unsaved work and DELETED on
// every clean transition — save, load, new, and a confirmed EXIT — so an autosave that survives to
// the next launch means the last session did not end cleanly. That is what the RECOVER WORK? prompt
// keys on, and it is why nothing here needs a timestamp, a flag or a header: the file either is there
// or it is not, and each answer means exactly one thing. Kotlin puts it in one line (AutosaveManager):
// "its presence at next launch signals an unclean exit".
//
// Which makes the DELETIONS as load-bearing as the writes, and easier to forget. A clean save that
// leaves the file behind asks the user to recover work they have already safely stored — and trains
// them to dismiss the one prompt in the app that exists to save their song.
//
// ── ⚠️ IT IS WRITTEN THROUGH `FileSystem::write_file`, AND NOTHING ELSE MAY WRITE IT ─────────────
//
// That is not a stylistic preference — it is the reason the temp-file dance exists at all.
// `write_file` writes `<path>.tmp`, checks the close, and only then renames it over the target
// (StdFileSystem::write_bytes, AndroidFileSystem.writeFile). A plain `ofstream` opened with `trunc`
// destroys the old file at open time and cannot report a failure that surfaces at the flush.
//
// **The autosave is the file where that difference bites hardest, because it is written precisely
// when the machine is about to die.** The SIGTERM flush runs with a launcher's SIGKILL possibly
// seconds behind it; a hardware power slider does not negotiate. A non-atomic write interrupted
// halfway does not merely fail to save the new work — it has already TRUNCATED the previous, good
// autosave in order to fail. That is strictly worse than never having written at all, and it turns
// the one file whose job is to survive a bad death into the one file guaranteed not to.
//
// ── WHAT HAS NO TWIN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `AutosaveManager` itself. Its entire content is a THREADING split — serialize on the main thread
// (the project's sole mutator, so the walk cannot observe a half-applied edit), write the bytes on
// `Dispatchers.IO`. There is one thread here and it is the one holding the document, so the split has
// nothing to split: the serialize and the write are the same call, on the same thread, and the
// tear-freedom Kotlin has to arrange is a property of the program rather than a discipline.
//
// The DEBOUNCE has no twin here either, for the opposite reason — it is not missing, it MOVED. Kotlin
// debounces in a `LaunchedEffect(projectVersion)` that a new edit re-keys and therefore cancels; the
// shell has no coroutines, so it is a deadline in `InputDispatcher::set_now()`, beside the sample
// editor's preview restore. Same behaviour, said out loud instead of arranged by a framework.

 * its relative paths against the folder it happens to sit in and every instrument comes back silent —
 * with the project itself looking perfectly correct on screen, which is the worst way for it to fail.
 * The shell hands in what it hands `load_media` at boot; ptdispatch hands in its temp Samples folder.
 *
 * The DIRTY flag is NOT this function's business — it is the caller's, and it is the one thing about
 * recovery that is easy to get backwards. See `InputDispatcher::recover_from_autosave`.
