/**
 * native/ui/platform_caps.h — what THIS platform can actually do.
 *
 * SETTINGS is the first screen in the whole port where the two platforms genuinely DIFFER. Every
 * screen before it edits the PROJECT or the filesystem, and a project is a project everywhere. But
 * half of SETTINGS is about the DEVICE: Android has touch layouts, a skinned virtual D-pad, button
 * click sounds and haptics, and a KT/C++ sequencer switch. A handheld running the SDL shell has
 * physical buttons, no Kotlin, and — the one thing Android has never needed — a way to QUIT.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CAPS ARE A VALUE, NOT AN #ifdef, AND THAT IS THE ENTIRE DESIGN.
 *
 * An `#ifdef __ANDROID__` would have been three lines shorter and would have cost the session its
 * measuring stick. Every module in this port is goldened by byte-comparing it against the REAL
 * Kotlin module it replaces (`tools/ptinput`), and a settings screen compiled with Android's rows
 * *removed* cannot be compared against a Kotlin settings screen that HAS them — there would be
 * nothing to compare, and the port would be taking its most divergent screen entirely on trust.
 *
 * As a value, the same C++ code answers both questions:
 *
 *   • `PlatformCaps::android(debug)` reproduces Kotlin's row map EXACTLY, hidden rows and all — so
 *     ptinput can drive it row-for-row against the recorded Kotlin golden.
 *   • `PlatformCaps::sdl(debug)` is what the shell actually runs.
 *
 * The divergence becomes a parameter, and the port is measured against Kotlin with the divergence
 * turned OFF. That is the only honest way to ship a screen that is deliberately different.
 *
 * (`debug` is in here too, rather than as a `#ifdef NDEBUG`, for the same reason and one more: it is
 * what Kotlin ALREADY does — `BuildConfig.DEBUG` is read inline in SettingsModule's draw, in its
 * cursor movement and in ProjectModule's RAM readout. The port plan §5 asks for exactly this: "rows
 * filtered by a small PlatformCaps flags struct (also cleans up the existing debug-only rows
 * pattern)".)

     * engine_consumer's routing gate still raised no voice for it — a silently dead track with
     * nothing on screen to explain it. So a build with this off cannot CREATE MIDI data, and renders
     * whatever it finds truthfully.
