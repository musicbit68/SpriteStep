# Input System

SPRITESTEP uses a hybrid input system combining M8's editing precision with LGPT's dual-modifier
approach. One generic input handler serves every screen, so the same kind of value behaves the same
way wherever you meet it.

---

## Control Layout

### Keyboard Mapping

```
D-PAD:    W (up) / S (down) / A (left) / D (right)
          Arrow keys also work

A button: K or Enter
B button: J or Escape
L button: U (left shoulder/modifier)
R button: I (right shoulder/modifier)
SELECT:   Left Shift
START:    Spacebar
```

### Physical Gamepad

```
D-PAD:    Physical D-pad
A/B:      A and B face buttons (X/Y also map to A/B)
L/R:      L1 / R1 shoulder buttons
SELECT:   SELECT (SDL's "back" button)
START:    START
```

**L2/R2 and the analog sticks are not mapped.** Everything the app does is reachable from the ten
buttons above, and a trigger or a drifting stick therefore does nothing rather than something
surprising.

On Android the hardware **Back** key is always **B**, whatever else you rebind — B is the app's
universal cancel, so Back closes the file browser, aborts the keyboard and leaves an editor.

Keyboard and gamepad work simultaneously.

### Changing any of it — `config.json`

Every binding above is a default. The face-button layout and all ten key bindings can be changed by
hand in `config.json` in your SPRITESTEP folder; the app writes a starter copy on first launch and
then never touches the file again. See **[the manual, section 25](manual-en.md#25-configuration-file-configjson)**
for the schema, the key-name spellings and the 8BitDo/XInput case that makes A and B swap.

---

## Design Philosophy

**Modifier roles:**
- **A button** = "Edit this value" (hold for increment/decrement)
- **B button** = "Which item am I looking at" (previous/next phrase, chain, instrument…)
- **L button** = "Clipboard and selection"
- **R button** = "Navigate screens"
- **SELECT** = "What is this?" — help for the cell under the cursor, and the modifier for rename, delete
  and new folder in the file browser

This creates a consistent, learnable pattern where:
- You don't memorize different controls per screen
- The same value type behaves the same everywhere
- Modifiers have clear, distinct purposes

**Heritage:** M8-style editing precision + LGPT-style dual-modifier ergonomics.

---

## Basic Controls

### Cursor Navigation
- **D-PAD** - Move cursor up/down/left/right
- **UP at row 0** - Wraps to last row
- **DOWN at last row** - Wraps to row 0

### Basic Actions
- **A button** - Insert value on empty cell
- **B button** - Cancel / back / copy a selection
- **SELECT** - Shows help for the cell under the cursor: the visualizer strip at the top of the screen
  becomes three lines describing it, and any other button puts it away. In the file browser it is the
  modifier for the rename / delete / new-folder chords instead, and it cancels the keyboard overlay.
  ⚠️ SELECT does **not** delete — clearing a value is always **A + B**.
- **START** - Play/Stop sequencer

### Key Repeat
- Hold D-PAD, A+DPAD, or B+DPAD for continuous input (400ms delay, 100ms interval)
- The modifiers are re-read as the repeat fires, so pressing A while UP is already repeating turns a
  cursor move into a value edit without letting go.

---

## A + Direction (Value Editing)

Hold A and press directions to edit values:

### Small Steps
- **A + RIGHT** - Increment by 1
- **A + LEFT** - Decrement by 1

### Large Steps
- **A + UP** - Increment by 16 (hex) or 12 semitones (notes)
- **A + DOWN** - Decrement by 16 (hex) or 12 semitones (notes)

### Delete
- **A + B** - Delete the value at the cursor, or reset it to its default where the cell cannot be
  empty (PAN, DRIVE, the sends…)

### Insert
- **A** on an empty cell inserts the **last-edited** chain/phrase.
- **A, A** (a double-tap inside 300 ms) inserts the next **unused** one instead — the fast way to
  start a fresh phrase.

---

## Value Types

The tracker automatically adjusts behavior based on what you're editing:

| Type | Range | Small Step | Large Step | Past the end |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| HEX_BYTE | 00-FF | 1 | 16 | Wraps (FF+1=00) |
| PHRASE_REF | 00-FF | 1 | 16 | Wraps |
| CHAIN_REF | 00-FF | 1 | 16 | Wraps |
| INSTRUMENT_REF | 00-7F | 1 | 16 | Wraps |
| VOLUME | 00-7F | 1 | 16 | Wraps |
| SEMITONE_OFFSET | 00-FF | 1 semitone | 12 semitones | Wraps |
| NOTE | C-0 to G-9 | 1 semitone | 12 semitones | Clamps |
| HEX_NIBBLE | 0-F | 1 | 4 | Clamps |
| EFFECT_TYPE | the effect list | 1 | 1 | Wraps |
| EFFECT_VALUE | 00-FF (per effect) | 1 | 16 | Wraps |
| GAIN (EQ, dB) | −12.0 … +12.0 | 0.1 dB | 1.0 dB | Clamps |
| FREQ (EQ, Hz) | 20 Hz … 20 kHz | 1 | 16 | Clamps |
| CHARACTER | A-Z 0-9 _ - space | 1 | 1 | Wraps |
| TOGGLE | the option list | 1 | 1 | Wraps |

The split is deliberate: discrete values **wrap**, so a four-button device can dial one in by holding
a direction. Continuous physical units — EQ gain in dB, EQ frequency in Hz — **clamp**, because
wrapping +12 dB round to −12 dB would be a trap rather than a convenience. HEX_NIBBLE clamps for the
same reason: holding A+RIGHT on CRUSH stops at F instead of quietly undoing what you were dialling in.

---

## R + Direction (Screen Navigation)

Hold R and press directions to navigate the 5×5 screen grid:

|  | col 0 | col 1 | col 2 | col 3 | col 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **row 0** | | | SCALE | INST.POOL | |
| **row 1** | PROJECT | PROJECT | GROOVE | MODS | PROJECT |
| **row 2** | SONG | CHAIN | PHRASE | INSTRUMENT | TABLE |
| **row 3** | MIXER | MIXER | MIXER | MIXER | MIXER |
| **row 4** | EFFECTS | EFFECTS | EFFECTS | EFFECTS | EFFECTS |

- The main screens (SONG/CHAIN/PHRASE/INSTRUMENT/TABLE) are row 2, and R+LEFT/RIGHT walks along it.
- PROJECT, MIXER and EFFECTS are shared: they sit in every column and have none of their own, so
  leaving one of them is answered relative to the column you entered it from — R+UP goes to the
  screen above it in that column, and R+LEFT/RIGHT to the main-row screen one column to either side.
- Row 0 and row 1 are column-specific — R+UP from PHRASE reaches GROOVE and then SCALE, R+UP from
  INSTRUMENT reaches MODS and then INST.POOL.

**R elsewhere:** in the file browser **R+LEFT** goes up one directory level and **R+UP/DOWN** cycles
the sort mode. In the QWERTY overlay **R+LEFT/RIGHT** scrolls the text cursor, accelerating from 1 to
4 characters per repeat, and **R+UP/DOWN** switches between the letter and number layouts. In the
SAMPLE EDITOR **R+UP/DOWN** zooms the waveform from wherever the cursor is.

The full-screen overlays (SAMPLE EDITOR, EQ EDITOR, THEME EDITOR) own no cell in the grid above, so
R+DPAD never navigates out of one — anything not listed here is swallowed. **B** is the way out, and
on a modified sample it asks first.

### Instrument Pool fast-jump (INST_POOL ↔ INSTRUMENT)

The Instrument Pool (row 0 / col 3) pairs with a contextual INSTRUMENT cell to its right for quickly
bouncing between the pool and the instrument view:

- **From INST_POOL:** R+RIGHT → INSTRUMENT, R+LEFT → PHRASE, R+DOWN → MODS.
- **From the instrument reached that way:** R+LEFT → back to INST_POOL, R+DOWN → MODS, R+UP/R+RIGHT stay.
- The normal (row-2) INSTRUMENT is unchanged: R+LEFT → PHRASE, R+RIGHT → TABLE, R+UP → MODS, R+DOWN → MIXER.

### Instrument Pool screen controls

A list of all 128 instrument slots with a short mixer strip per slot: `## NAME V RV DE EQ`. The
selected row IS the project's current instrument (shared with the INSTRUMENT view).

- **UP / DOWN** — move the selection (wraps 00↔7F); **B+UP / B+DOWN** — fast-scroll ±16 (clamps at ends).
- **LEFT / RIGHT** — move between columns (NAME → V → RV → DE → EQ).
- **A + DPAD** — edit the value under the cursor (V/RV/DE = 00–FF, EQ = 00–7F).
- **A** on the NAME column of an **empty** slot — load a source (sampler slots browse .wav, SoundFont
  slots browse .sf2 and .sf3); the slot is auto-named from the file.
- **A + B** on the NAME column — clear the slot (keeps its instrument type).
- **A** (tap) on the EQ column — open the per-instrument EQ editor (A+DPAD still picks
  the slot; the open is deferred to A-release so the two don't clash). Inside the editor, **B** closes it.
- **START** — preview the selected instrument (when stopped).

---

## B + Direction (Item Navigation)

Hold B and press directions to change *which* item the screen is showing, without leaving it:

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **B + LEFT / RIGHT** | Previous / next phrase, chain, instrument, table or groove — whichever the screen edits |
| **B + LEFT / RIGHT** (EQ EDITOR) | Previous / next EQ preset slot |
| **B + UP / DOWN** (SONG) | Page up / down 16 rows |
| **B + UP / DOWN** (INST.POOL) | Jump ±16 slots |

### Under `SETTINGS -> NAV = SONG` (the default)

B + D-pad on CHAIN and PHRASE walks the **arrangement** instead of the pools. The cursor is a song
cell, so the chain and phrase on screen are whichever ones that cell names, and the CHAIN and PHRASE
headers show it (`CHAIN 20  S01 T3`).

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **B + LEFT / RIGHT** (CHAIN) | Nearest filled song cell left / right in the same song row. Clamps |
| **B + UP / DOWN** (CHAIN) | Nearest filled song cell up / down the same track column, skipping gaps. Clamps |
| **B + LEFT / RIGHT** (PHRASE) | Nearest track left / right whose chain also has a phrase at this chain row. Clamps |
| **B + UP / DOWN** (PHRASE) | Previous / next filled row of the current chain. Never leaves the chain |
| **UP / DOWN** (PHRASE) | Off step 00 / 0F, spills into the previous / next filled chain row |
| **R + RIGHT** (SONG, CHAIN) | Does nothing when the cell under the cursor is empty |

The other screens are unchanged: SONG still pages by 16, and INSTRUMENT, MODS, TABLE, GROOVE and
INST.POOL still walk their pools.

---

## Copy/Paste (M8-Style)

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **L+B** | Enter selection mode; tap again inside 500 ms to widen it (CELL -> ROW -> SCREEN) |
| **D-PAD (in selection)** | Expand/contract selection |
| **B (in selection)** | Copy + exit |
| **L+A (in selection)** | Cut (copy + delete) + exit |
| **L+A (outside selection)** | Paste at cursor |
| **A+B (in selection)** | Delete (no clipboard) + exit |
| **L+B+A** | Deep-clone the chain/phrase under the cursor into free slots |
| **L+R** | Leave selection mode — the copy buffer survives. Pressed *outside* a selection it clears the buffer instead, which is how you dismiss the clipboard readout in the top strip. |

**Screens supported:** PHRASE, CHAIN, SONG, TABLE

**Selection increment:** A+DPAD applies to all selected rows in active column.

---

## Mute & Solo — a chord that is momentary or latching

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **R+B** | Toggle mute on the track under the cursor (SONG, MIXER) |
| **R+A** | Toggle solo, same targeting |
| **either, over a selection** | Applies to every track the selection's columns cover |
| **L+R** | Restore full playback |

**Which button comes up first is the gesture.** The chord acts on the press; releasing **R** first
latches it, and releasing **A** or **B** first undoes everything that chord did. One chord is
therefore both a mute you set and a mute you hold through a bar.

The revert restores all eight tracks, not the one under the cursor: a chord over a selection touches
several, and a solo changes what every other track is heard doing.

On the MIXER, column 8 is the master strip and the chord is a no-op there. On every screen other
than SONG and MIXER it stays the consumed no-op it has always been.

---

## File Browser

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **D-PAD UP/DOWN** | Move through files and folders |
| **A** | Load the file / enter the folder |
| **A** on `..` | Up one directory level |
| **R+LEFT** | Up one directory level |
| **B** | Close the browser |
| **START** | Preview the highlighted audio file |
| **SELECT+A** | Rename the file or folder under the cursor (opens the keyboard) |
| **SELECT+B** | Delete it — arms an `A=YES B=NO` confirm; nothing is deleted on the press itself |
| **SELECT+R** | Create a folder here (opens the keyboard) |
| **L+B** | Start a file selection; tap again inside 500 ms to select all |
| **B (in selection)** | Copy the selected files |
| **L+A (in selection)** | Cut the selected files |
| **L+A (outside selection)** | Paste them here |
| **L+R** | Cancel the file selection |

**On Android's granted-folders list** (the top of the browser, `pt://roots`), the three SELECT chords
mean something else, because a granted folder is a *permission* rather than a file: rename, delete and
create-here are all refused there, and the top bar says so.

| | |
|---|---|
| **SELECT+A** | Make the folder under the cursor the home folder — where the app keeps `Projects/`, `Samples/` and the rest. Arms an `A=YES B=NO` confirm. Nothing on disk moves. |
| **SELECT+B** | Forget it: hand the access back to Android and drop the row. Arms the same confirm. ⚠️ Not a delete — no file is touched, and re-granting the folder restores it. |

The folder in use is drawn `(HOME)`; one whose directory no longer exists is drawn `(MISSING)` and is
never chosen as the home.

## All Button Combinations

### Tier 1: Basic Actions (No modifiers)

```
A                       Insert value on empty / Enter edit mode
A, A                    Insert the next UNUSED chain/phrase (double-tap, 300 ms)
A + RIGHT               Increment by small step (+1)
A + LEFT                Decrement by small step (-1)
A + UP                  Increment by large step (+16 or +12)
A + DOWN                Decrement by large step (-16 or -12)
A + B                   Delete value / reset it to its default
B                       Cancel / Exit / Back / Copy a selection
B on EFFECTS' TIME row  Switch the delay time between milliseconds and note lengths
SELECT                  Help for the cell under the cursor (and the file-management modifier;
                        cancels the keyboard overlay)
START                   Play / Stop
```

### Tier 2: B Modifier (Item Navigation)

```
B + LEFT/RIGHT          Previous / next phrase, chain, instrument, table, groove
B + UP/DOWN             Page the SONG screen / jump 16 instrument slots
```

### Tier 3: L Modifier (Selection & Clipboard)

```
L + A                   Paste (outside selection) / Cut (in selection)
L + B                   Enter selection mode / widen it
L + B + A               Clone current item (deep clone)
L + R                   Restore muted tracks / leave selection mode / clear the copy buffer
```

**L + R undoes one thing per press, most recent first.** Two things are on it: the mute and solo
state, and the selection with its copy buffer. Whichever was touched last is cleared first, and a
press falls through to the other when the first has nothing to clear.

### Tier 4: R Modifier (Navigation)

```
R + UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT  Navigate between screens
R + LEFT                Up one directory (file browser)
R + LEFT/RIGHT          Scroll the text cursor (QWERTY overlay)
R + B                   Mute the track under the cursor  (SONG, MIXER)
R + A                   Solo it                          (SONG, MIXER)
```

### Tier 5: SELECT Modifier (File management)

```
SELECT + A              Rename                  (file browser)
SELECT + B              Delete, with a confirm  (file browser)
SELECT + R              New folder              (file browser)
```

### Reserved chords

These are deliberately **consumed and do nothing**, so that holding a modifier cannot fire an edit
underneath it. They are listed so they aren't mistaken for broken controls:

```
L + R + A, L + R + B, L + R + SELECT
```

`L + START` and `R + START` are consumed the same way everywhere except the SONG screen in LIVE
mode, where they queue a row and queue a channel's stop. They never toggle playback and never
silence a preview.

---

## Architecture

### Cursor Context System

Instead of checking which screen we're on, the system checks **what type of data the cursor is on**.

Each screen module implements `cursor_context(state)`, which answers "the cursor is on a NOTE, it is
empty, it can be inserted, its range is 12..127, a small step is 1 and a large step is 12". One
generic handler turns button presses into actions from that answer alone, so every screen gets
increment / decrement / fast-step / delete / insert for free.

**Key files:**
- `native/ui/cursor.h` — the value types, capabilities, stepping rules and the five button→action functions
- `native/ui/button_mapper.h` — the combo matrix: which of the ~30 named handlers a press means
- `native/ui/input_dispatcher.{h,cpp}` — what each handler does
- `shell/sdl-input.cpp` — the only platform-specific part: SDL keys and pad buttons → the ten buttons

### Adding Input to a New Screen

1. Return a `CursorContext` from your module's `cursor_context(state)` for each cursor position
2. Use the `cc::` factories (`hex_byte`, `note`, `toggle_ternary`, …) rather than filling the struct
3. All A+direction and A+B combos then work automatically

## M8 vs LGPT Design Decisions

SPRITESTEP takes the best of both systems:

| Feature | Source | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| A + directions for editing | M8 | More precise control |
| LEFT/RIGHT small step, UP/DOWN large step | LGPT | The axis split LGPT users already have in their fingers |
| Dual modifiers (L/R) | LGPT | More ergonomic |
| Deep clone | M8 | Powerful unique feature |
| Selection mode cycling | M8 | More flexible |
| L + A for paste | LGPT | Simpler than SHIFT+EDIT |
| R + directions for screen nav | LGPT | Logical separation |
